  abstract  = {From the Publisher:This new text examines the design and implementation of Icc, a production-quality, retargetable compiler, designed at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and Princeton University for the ANSI C programming language. The authors' innovative approach - a "literate program" that intermingles the text with the source code - gives a detailed tour of the code that explains the implementation and design decisions reflected in the software. And while most books describe toy compilers or focus on isolated pieces of code, the authors have made available the entire source code for a real compiler. Structured as a self-study guide that describes the real-world tradeoffs encountered in building a production-quality compiler, A Retargetable C Compiler is also useful to individuals who work in application areas using or creating language-based tools and techniques. Features: discusses the implementation and design tradeoffs made while constructing a real ANSI C compiler, illustrating the interaction between theory and practice; covers compiler theory only as needed to understand the implementation of Icc, focusing instead on practical, applied issues; encourages a deeper understanding of programming in C, by providing C programmers with a tour of the language from the perspective of compiler authors; includes coverage of code generators for the MIPS R3000, SPARC, and Intel 386 and its successors; and provides access to the full source code for the Icc compiler, the three back ends, and the code-generator generator, either on disk or via FTP.}

  abstract   = {To accurately render a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene, global illumination information that affects the intensity of each pixel of the image must be known at the time the intensity is calculated. In a simplified form, this information is stored in a tree of “rays” extending from the viewer to the first surface encountered and from there to other surfaces and to the light sources. A visible surface algorithm creates this tree for each pixel of the display and passes it to the shader. The shader then traverses the tree to determine the intensity of the light received by the viewer. Consideration of all of these factors allows the shader to accurately simulate true reflection, shadows, and refraction, as well as the effects simulated by conventional shaders. Anti-aliasing is included as an integral part of the visibility calculations. Surfaces displayed include curved as well as polygonal surfaces.},

Current light reflection models used in computer graphics do not account for the object-to-object reflection between diffuse surfaces, and thus incorrectly compute the global illumination effects. The new procedure, based on methods used in thermal engineering, includes the effects of diffuse light sources of finite area, as well as the “color-bleeding” effects which are caused by the diffuse reflections. A simple environment is used to illustrate these simulated effects and is presented with photographs of a physical model. The procedure is applicable to environments composed of ideal diffuse reflectors and can account for direct illumination from a variety of light sources. The resultant surface intensities are independent of observer position, and thus environments can be preprocessed for dynamic sequences.},

In essence, each object in the environment is treated as a secondary light source. The method provides an accurate representation of the "diffuse" and "ambient" terms found in typical image synthesis algorithms. The phenomena of "color bleeding" from one surface to another, shading within shadow envelopes, and penumbras along shadow boundaries are accurately reproduced. Additional advantages result because computations are indepedent of viewer position. This allows the efficient rendering of multiple views of the same scene for dynamic sequences. Light sources can be modulated and object reflectivities can be changed, with minimal extra computation. The procedures extend the radiosity method beyond the bounds previously imposed.},

Many phenomena that are difficult or impossible with other techniques are simple with ray tracing, including shadows, reflections, and refracted light. Ray directions, however, have been determined precisely, and this has limited the capabilities of ray tracing. By distributing the directions of the rays according to the analytic function they sample, ray tracing can incorporate fuzzy phenomena. This provides correct and easy solutions to some previously unsolved or partially solved problems, including motion blur, depth of field, penumbras, translucency, and fuzzy reflections. Motion blur and depth of field calculations can be integrated with the visible surface calculations, avoiding the problems found in previous methods. },

Consequently, many of the powerful techniques which have been developed in these fields can be applied to problems in image synthesis. In this paper we adapt several statistical techniques commonly used in neutron transport to stochastic ray tracing and, more generally, to Monte Carlo solution of the rendering equation. First, we describe a technique known as Russian roulette which can be used to terminate the recursive tracing of rays without introducing statistical bias. We also examine the practice of creating ray trees in classical ray tracing in the light of a well-known technique in particle transport known as splitting. We show that neither ray trees nor paths as described in [10] constitute an optimal sampling plan in themselves and that a hybrid may be more efficient.},

This bias is dependent upon the image function being sampled as well as the strategy for determining the number of samples to use. It is most prominent in areas of high contrast and is attributable to early stages of sampling systematically favoring one extreme or the other. If the expected outcome of the entire adaptive sampling algorithm is considered, we find that the bias of the early decisions is still present in the final estimator. We propose an alternative strategy for performing adaptive sampling that is unbiased but potentially more costly. We conclude that it may not always be practical to mitigate this source of bias, but as a source of error it should be considered when high accuracy and image fidelity are a central concern.},

  abstract    = {Realistic image generation is presented in a theoretical formulation that builds from previous work on the rendering equation. Previous and new solution techniques for the global illumination are discussed in the context of this formulation. The physical rules governing reflection are used to make improvements in local reflection models. The conventional local illumination models used in computer graphics are examined and modified to be consistent with these physical rules.Global illumination is treated in terms of evaluation of a Global Radiance Function. Image-based solution methods are phrased as a lazy evaluation of the Global Radiance Function; evaluation takes place for visible points. Zonal solution methods are phrased as table based solutions. A proof is given that, subject to certain constraints, only O(N) rays are required for a zonal solution with N zones. Simulation allows for surfaces which are not zoned to interact with those that are.The ray tracing zonal solution methods used for surfaces are extended to scenes with participating media. The impact of wavelength selection and time dependencies is also discussed.An object oriented implementation is discussed. This implementation separates the local and global illumination modules, so all of the specifics of the local models are hidden from the global energy transport code. This allows new local modules to be added by specifying the black box access routines.},

Importance sampling involves the design of integrand-specific probability density functions that are used to generate sample points for the numerical quadrature. Probability density functions are presented that aid in the direct lighting calculation from luminaires of various simple shapes. A method for defining a probability density function over a set of luminaires is presented that allows the direct lighting calculation to be carried out with a number of sample points that is independent of the number of luminaires.},

Because the most popular algorithms frequently change, it is increasingly important for researchers and implementors to have a basic understanding of the principles of image synthesis. Focusing on theory, Andrew Glassner provides a comprehensive explanation of the three core fields of study that come together to form digital image synthesis: the human visual system, digital signal processing, and the interaction of matter and light. Assuming no more than a basic background in calculus, Glassner transforms his passion and expertise into a thorough presentation of each of these disciplines, and their elegant orchestration into modern rendering techniques such as radiosity and ray tracing.}

The simulation blends deterministic and stochastic ray-tracing techniques to achieve the best balance between speed and accuracy in its local and global illumination methods. Some of the more interesting techniques are outlined, with references to more detailed descriptions elsewhere.

  abstract  = {Some applications of computer graphics require a vivid illusion of reality. These include the spatial organization of machine parts, conceptual architectural design, simulation of mechanisms, and industrial design. There has been moderate success in the automatic generation of wire frame, cardboard model, polyhedra, and quadric surface line drawings. The capability of the machine to generate vivid sterographic pictures has been demonstrated. There are, however considerable reasons for developing techniques by which line drawings of solids can be shaded, especially the enhancement of the sense of solidity and depth. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the value of shading and shadow casting in spatial description. In the line drawing there is no clue as to the relative position of the flat plane and the sheet metal console. When shadows are rendered, it is clear that the plane is below and to the rear of the console, and the hollow nature of the sheet metal assembly is emphasized. Shading can specify the tone or color of a surface and the amount of light falling upon that surface from one or more light sources. Shadows when sharply defined tend to suggest another viewpoint and improves surface definition. When controlled, shading can also emphasize particular parts of the drawing. If techniques for the automatic determination of chiaroscuro with good resolution should prove to be competitive with line drawings, and this is a possibility, machine generated photographs might replace line drawings as the principal mode of graphical communication in engineering and architecture.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a visual simulation technique by which fully computer-generated perspective views of three-dimensional objects may be produced. The method is based on a relatively simple geometric modeling technique for the mathematical representa tion of the three elements essential to the picture- taking process, namely, a camera, a light source, and the object or objects to be photographed. Once these three basic components have been defined, geometric ray tracing is employed to compute a "picture" of the object as it appears in the simu- Zated camera. In essence, individual light rays are traced from their source to the surface of the object. The reflected component of each ray is computed and traced to its point of intersection with the film plane. Thus, each reflected ray pro vides the intensity at a single point on the pic ture, and, when a sufficient number of points have been computed, the entire area of intensity data may be displayed on a cathode ray tube. Several examples of the pictorial output of this process are shown, and the application to the computer- generated films is discussed. }

  abstract  = {Simple transparency algorithms which assume a linear transparency over an entire surface are the type most often employed to produce computer synthesized images of transparent objects with curved surfaces. Although most of the images created with these algorithms do give the impression of transparency, they usually do not look realistic. One of the most serious problems is that the intensity of the light that is transmitted through the objects is generally not proportional to the amount of material through which it must pass. Another problem is that the image seen behind the objects is not distorted as would naturally occur when the light is refracted as it passes through a material of different density.Use of a non-linear transparency algorithm can provide a great improvement in the realism of an image at a small additional cost. Making the transparency proportional to the normal to the surface causes it to decrease towards the edges of the surface where the path of the light through the object is longer. The exact simulation of refraction, however, requires that each sight ray be individually traced from the observer, through the picture plane and through each transparent object until an opaque surface is intersected. Since the direction of the ray would change as each material of differing optical density was entered, the hidden surface calculations required would be very time consuming. However, if a few assumptions are made about the geometry of each object and about the conditions under which they are viewed, a much simplier algorithm can be used to approximate the refractive effect. This method proceeds in a back to front order, mapping the current background image onto the next surface, until all surfaces have been considered.},

  abstract  = {From the Publisher: Introduced by Pixar Studios over a decade ago, the RenderMan Interface Specification is the dominant standard for sending data to the leading rendering programs used by 3D artists and animators. But users are hampered by the lack of authoritative, up-to-date information on applying the standard, having long had to rely on the ten-year-old RenderMan Companion and a far-flung collection of course notes and Web sites. Advanced RenderMan: Beyond the Companion is precisely what RenderMan users are dying for. It offers thoroughly updated coverage while moving beyond the original work's scope to provide in-depth information on dozens of advanced topics. Both a reference and a tutorial, this book will be indispensable to graphics programmers, modelers, animators, technical directors, and hobbyists-it is truly the key to their ability to achieve state-of-the-art 3D effects. Key Features: Written by the world's foremost RenderMan experts-key figures at Pixar, the company that developed and first implemented the standard Offers advanced users instruction not available anywhere else while providing a leg up to relative beginners-including tips on avoiding mistakes and an appendix covering key math skills. Filled with technical illustrations and many full-color representations of effects supported by the RenderMan standard Via a companion Web site, provides comprehensive documentation of the standard's semantics and syntax, example source code, shaders and other software, and the full set of SIGGRAPH course notes on RenderMan}

               This chapter describes the quaternions and 4 x 4 matrices. Quaternions are steadily replacing Euler angles as the internal representation of orientations. They mesh remarkably well with 4 × 4 homogeneous matrices. Matrix multiplication can be used quite nicely for quaternion multiplication, because quaternions are, in fact, four-component homogeneous coordinates for orientations, and because they multiply linearly. A quaternion q as a 4-vector, written as (xq, yq, zq, wq), or as just (x, y, z, w) is described. Some systems do not implement matrix manipulations carefully, and will misbehave if the bottom right entry of the matrix is not 1. Even when normalization is desired, it is not necessary to compute a square root and only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are used. It is found that only the last row and column of the two matrices differ, and then only by transposition or sign change.}

  abstract  = {Solid bodies roll and tumble through space. In computer animation, so do cameras. The rotations of these objects are best described using a four coordinate system, quaternions, as is shown in this paper. Of all quaternions, those on the unit sphere are most suitable for animation, but the question of how to construct curves on spheres has not been much explored. This paper gives one answer by presenting a new kind of spline curve, created on a sphere, suitable for smoothly in-betweening (i.e. interpolating) sequences of arbitrary rotations. Both theory and experiment show that the motion generated is smooth and natural, without quirks found in earlier methods.},

Yet illicit expressions containing terms like P + Q, cP, P X Q, etc. often appear in graphics textbooks, papers, and programs. In this paper we justify the use of such illicit expressions, and we we give criteria for recognizing when such an expression is truly legitimate. In particular we show that an algebraic expression E (P1, …, Pn) is legitimate if and only if E(v1 +  w, …vn + w) = E(v1, …, vn) + kw, k + 0, 1. We also derive many useful examples of such an expression.},

We prove existence and uniqueness properties of the weighted averages, and give fast iterative algorithms with linear and quadratic convergence rates. Our methods are appropriate to problems involving averages of spherical data in meteorological, geophysical, and astronomical applications. One simple application is a method for smooth averaging of quaternions, which generalizes Shoemake's spherical linear interpolation.The weighted averages methods allow a novel method of defining B\'{e}zier and spline curves on spheres, which provides direct generalization of B\'{e}zier and B-spline curves to spherical spline curves. We present a fast algorithm for spline interpolation on spheres. Our spherical splines allow the use of arbitrary knot positions; potential applications of spherical splines include smooth quaternion curves for applications in graphics, animation, robotics, and motion planning.},

  abstract  = {We present a general method for automatic reconstruction of accurate, concise, piecewise smooth surface models from scattered range data. The method can be used in a variety of applications such as reverse engineering—the automatic generation of CAD models from physical objects. Novel aspects of the method are its ability to model surfaces of arbitrary topological type and to recover sharp features such as creases and corners. The method has proven to be effective, as demonstrated by a number of examples using both simulated and real data.A key ingredient in the method, and a principal contribution of this paper, is the introduction of a new class of piecewise smooth surface representations based on subdivision. These surfaces have a number of properties that make  them ideal for use in surface reconstruction: they are simple to implement, they can model sharp features concisely, and they can be fit to scattered range data using an unconstrained optimization procedure.},

  abstractnote = {Photorealistic image synthesis can be described by a path integral. This integral is numerically approximated by summing up contributions of transport paths that connect light sources and sensors like e.g. a camera or the eye. The paths are trajectories of Markov processes, whose edges are straight lines along rays of light and whose vertices are light scattering events. The goal of this thesis was to accelerate the simulation of light transport, to find new algorithms and data structures to efficiently trace rays, and to better approximate the distribution of light by simultaneously simulating an ensemble of paths instead of single trajectories, using quasi-Monte-Carlo methods. We first present new data structures and heuristics that feature a smaller memory footprint at improved numerical precision. In addition it is possible to ray trace even massive scenes in a strictly limited, a priori fixed, memory block using rapid construction techniques that allow to rebuild the complete data structure at interactive frame rates. All efforts were combined in a unified framework that further allows one to build the acceleration hierarchy using an on demand policy and optionally balance the construction time versus the ray intersection time. Besides finding faster ray tracing algorithms, the total number of rays to be shot was reduced by mathematical means. By simplifying complicated mathematical schemes in a non-obvious way, the time complexity of the quasi-Monte-Carlo simulation process was reduced. When concentrating on the fact that the underlying Fredholm integral equation is in fact of low dimensional structure if not solved by the Neumann series, the resulting algorithms are simpler and in addition much more efficient. The combination of these new techniques allows photorealistic image synthesis in almost realtime. The results are demonstrated by several academic and industrial applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract Existing techniques for rendering arbitrary-form implicit surfaces are limited, either in performance, correctness or flexibility. Ray tracing algorithms employing interval arithmetic (IA) or affine arithmetic (AA) for root-funding are robust and general in the class of surfaces they support, but traditionally slow. Nonetheless, implemented efficiently using a stack-driven iterative algorithm and SIMD vector instructions, these methods can achieve interactive performance for common algebraic surfaces on the CPU. A similar algorithm can also be implemented stacklessly, allowing for efficient ray tracing on the GPU. This paper presents these algorithms, as well as an inclusion-preserving reduced affine arithmetic (RAA) for faster ray-surface intersection. Shader metaprogramming allows for immediate and automatic generation of symbolic expressions and their interval or affine extensions. Moreover, we are able to render even complex forms robustly, in real-time at high resolution.},

                natural irregular objects and phenomena without undue time or space overhead. We develop
                a new and powerful solution to this computer graphics problem by modeling objects
                as sample paths of stochastic processes. Of particular interest are those stochastic
                processes which previously have been found to be useful models of the natural phenomena
                to be represented. One such model applicable to the representation of terrains, known
                as “fractional Brownian motion,” has been developed by Mandelbrot.The value of a new
                approach to object modeling in computer graphics depends largely on the efficiency
                of the techniques used to implement the model. We introduce a new algorithm that computes
                a realistic, visually satisfactory approximation to fractional Brownian motion in
                faster time than with exact calculations. A major advantage of this technique is that
                it allows us to compute the surface to arbitrary levels of details without increasing
                the database. Thus objects with complex appearances can be displayed from a very small
                database. The character of the surface can be controlled by merely modifying a few
                parameters. A similar change allows complex motion to be created inexpensively.},

The problem of reporting wrong intersections, inherent to the original Bézier clipping algorithm14 , is inves-tigated and opposed to the triangular case. It turns out that reporting wrong hits is very improbable, even close to impossible, in the triangular set–up. A combination of Bézier clipping and a simple hierarchy of nested bounding volumes offers a reliable and accurate solution to the problem of ray tracing triangular Bézier patches.},

               improve the performance of interactive visualization and geometric processing algorithms.
               Given that the mesh is accessed in a reasonably coherent manner, we assume no particular
               data access patterns or cache parameters of the memory hierarchy involved in the computation.
               Furthermore, our formulation extends directly to computing layouts of multi-resolution
               and bounding volume hierarchies of large meshes.We develop a simple and practical
               cache-oblivious metric for estimating cache misses. Computing a coherent mesh layout
               is reduced to a combinatorial optimization problem. We designed and implemented an
               out-of-core multilevel minimization algorithm and tested its performance on unstructured
               meshes composed of tens to hundreds of millions of triangles. Our layouts can significantly
               reduce the number of cache misses. We have observed 2--20 times speedups in view-dependent
               rendering, collision detection, and isocontour extraction without any modification
               of the algorithms or runtime applications.},

                defined by sweeping a two-dimensional contour along a three-dimensional trajectory.
                The contour can be any 'well-behaved' curve in the sense that it is continuous, and
                that the points where the tangent is horizontal or vertical can be determined, the
                trajectory can be any spline curve. First a definition is given of generalized cylinders
                in terms of the Frenet frame of the trajectory. Then the main problem in ray tracing
                these objects, the computation of the intersection points with a ray, is reduced to
                the problem of intersecting two two-dimensional curves. This problem is solved by
                a subdivision algorithm. The three-dimensional normal at the intersection point closest
                to the eye point, necessary to perform shading, is obtained by transforming the two-dimensional
                normal at the corresponding intersection point of the two two-dimensional curves.
                In this way it is possible to obtain highly realistic images for a very broad class

The method is presented as a generalization of a recursive bicubic B-spline patch subdivision algorithm. For rectangular control-point meshes, the method generates a standard B-spline surface. For non-rectangular meshes, it generates surfaces that are shown to reduce to a standard B-spline surface except at a small number of points, called extraordinary points. Therefore, everywhere except at these points the surface is continuous in tangent and curvature. At the extraordinary points, the pictures of the surface indicate that the surface is at least continuous in tangent, but no proof of continuity is given. A similar algorithm for biquadratic B-splines is also presented.}

  abstract = {Abstract Subdivision Surfaces as well as (interactive) ray tracing have become an important issue in computer graphics.But ray tracing of subdivision surfaces has received only little attention. We present a new approach for raytracing of subdivision surfaces. The algorithm uses a projection of the ray onto the surface and works mainly intwo dimensions along this projection. While proceeding from patch to patch, we examine the bounding volume oftheir borders: the lower the distance between ray and subdivision surface, the more refinement steps are adaptivelyapplied to the surface but only along the projection of the ray. The adaptive refinement of a patch is controlled bycurvature, size, its membership to the silhouette, and its potential contribution to the light transport. The algorithmis simple and mainly consists of elementary geometric computations. Hence it is fast and easy to implementwithout the need for elaborate preprocessing. The algorithm is robust in the sense that it deals with all features ofsubdivision surfaces like creases and corners.

               smooth, free-form surfaces is attractive for content destined for display on devices
               with greatly varying rendering performance. Subdivision naturally supports level of
               detail rendering and powerful compression algorithms. While the underlying algorithms
               are conceptually simple it is difficult to implement player engines which achieve
               optimal performance on modern CPUs such as the Intel Pentium family.In this paper
               we describe a novel table driven evaluation strategy for subdivision surfaces using
               as an example the scheme of Catmull and Clark. Cache conscious design and exploitation
               of SIMD instructions allows us to achieve nearly 100\% FPU utilization in the inner
               loop and achieve a composite performance of 1.2 flop/cycle on the Intel PIII and 1.8
               flop/cycle on the Intel P4 including all memory transfers. The algorithm supports
               tradeoffs between cache size and memory bus usage which we examine. A library which

               subdivision surfaces entirely on programmable graphics hardware. Our scheme extends
               the concept of breadth-first subdivision, which up to this point has only been applied
               to parametric patches. While mesh representations designed for a CPU often involve
               pointer-based structures and irregular perelement storage, neither of these is well-suited
               to GPU execution. To solve this problem, we use a simple yet effective data structure
               for representing a subdivision mesh, and design a careful algorithm to update the
               mesh in a completely parallel manner. We demonstrate that in spite of the complexities
               of the subdivision procedure, real-time tessellation to pixel-sized primitives can
               be done.Our implementation does not rely on any approximation of the limit surface,
               and avoids both subdivision cracks and T-junctions in the subdivided mesh. Using the
               approach in this paper, we are able to perform real-time subdivision for several static

  abstract   = {Gappa is a tool designed to formally verify the correctness of numerical software
                and hardware. It uses interval arithmetic and forward error analysis to bound mathematical
                expressions that involve rounded as well as exact operators. It then generates a theorem
                and its proof for each verified enclosure. This proof can be automatically checked
                with a proof assistant, such as Coq or HOL Light. It relies on a large companion library
                of facts that we have developed. This Coq library provides theorems dealing with addition,
                multiplication, division, and square root, for both fixed- and floating-point arithmetics.
                Gappa uses multiple-precision dyadic fractions for the endpoints of intervals and
                performs forward error analysis on rounded operators when necessary. When asked, Gappa
                reports the best bounds it is able to reach for a given expression in a given context.
                This feature can be used to identify where the set of facts and automatic techniques
                implemented in Gappa becomes insufficient. Gappa handles seamlessly additional properties
                expressed as interval properties or rewriting rules in order to establish more intricate
                bounds. Recent work showed that Gappa is suited to discharge proof obligations generated
                for small pieces of software. They may be produced by third-party tools and the first
                applications of Gappa use proof obligations written by designers or obtained from

               Instead, it requires two upper bounds: "L" that limits the net rate of change of the

               We refer to an implicit surface with these rate limits as an "LG-implicit surface."Existing

Solid objects are modeled by combining primitive solids, such as blocks and cylinders, using the set operators union, intersection, and difference. To visualize and analyze the composite solids modeled, virtual light rays are cast as probes. By virtue of its simplicity, ray casting is reliable and extensible. The most difficult mathematical problem is finding line-surface intersection points. So surfaces such as planes, quadrics, tori, and probably even parametric surface patches may bound the primitive solids. The adequacy and efficiency of ray casting are issues addressed here. A fast picture generation capability for interactive modeling is the biggest challenge. New methods are presented, accompanied by sample pictures and CPU times, to meet the challenge.}

Designers often want the added flexibility of having both quads and triangles in their models. It is also well known that triangle meshes generate poor limit surfaces when using a quad scheme, while quad-only meshes behave poorly with triangular schemes. Our new scheme is a generalization of the well known Catmull-Clark and Loop subdivision algorithms. We show that our surfaces are C 1 everywhere and provide a proof that it is impossible to construct such a C 2 scheme at the quad/triangle boundary. However, we provide rules that produce surfaces with bounded curvature at the regular quad/triangle boundary and provide optimal masks that minimize the curvature divergence elsewhere. We demonstrate the visual quality of our surfaces with several examples. ACM CSS: I.3.5 Computer Graphics—Curve, surface, solid, and object representations},

  abstract  = {Surface elements (surfels) are a powerful paradigm to efficiently render complex geometric
               objects at interactive frame rates. Unlike classical surface discretizations, i.e.,
               triangles or quadrilateral meshes, surfels are point primitives without explicit connectivity.
               Surfel attributes comprise depth, texture color, normal, and others. As a pre-process,
               an octree-based surfel representation of a geometric object is computed. During sampling,
               surfel positions and normals are optionally perturbed, and different levels of texture
               colors are prefiltered and stored per surfel. During rendering, a hierarchical forward
               warping algorithm projects surfels to a z-buffer. A novel method called visibility
               splatting determines visible surfels and holes in the z-buffer. Visible surfels are
               shaded using texture filtering, Phong illumination, and environment mapping using
               per-surfel normals. Several methods of image reconstruction, including supersampling,
               offer flexible speed-quality tradeoffs. Due to the simplicity of the operations, the
               surfel rendering pipeline is amenable for hardware implementation. Surfel objects
               offer complex shape, low rendering cost and high image quality, which makes them specifically

               can be computed quickly, making it suitable for large data sets. Our implementation,
               written for use in a large-scale 3D digitization project, launches quickly, maintains
               a user-settable interactive frame rate regardless of object complexity or camera position,

  abstract  = {Although fractal models of natural phenomena have received much attention recently,
               there are other models of complex natural objects which have been around longer in
               Computer Imagery but are not widely known. These are procedural models of plants and
               trees. An interesting class of these models is presented here which handles plant
               growth, sports an efficient data representation, and has a high “database amplification”
               factor. It is based on an extension of the well-known formal languages of symbol strings
               to the lesser-known formal languages of labeled graphs. It is so tempting to describe
               these plant models as “fractal” that the similarities of this class of models with
               fractal models are explored in an attempt at rapprochement. The models are not fractal
               so the common parts of fractal theory and plant theory are abstracted to form a class
               of objects, the graftals. This class may prove to be of great interest to the future
               of Computer Imagery. Determinism is shown to provide adequate complexity, whereas
               randomness is only convenient and often inefficient. Finally, a nonfractal, nongraftal
               family of trees by Bill Reeves is introduced to emphasize some of the paper's nongrammatical
               themes.},

Recently, a number of authors have reported on ways to speed up this process by means of space subdivision which is used to minimize the number of intersection calculations. We describe such an algorithm together with an analysis of the factors which affect its performance. The critical operation of skipping an empty space subdivision can be done very quickly, using only integer addition and comparison. A theoretical analysis of the algorithm is developed. It shows how the space and time requirements vary with the number of objects in the scene.},

  abstract = {Abstract Data structures that handle very complex scenes (hundreds of thousands of objects) have in the past either been laboriously built by hand, or have required the determination of unintuitive parameter values by the user. It is often the case that an incorrect choice of these parameters can result in greedy memory requirements or severely degraded performance. As a remedy to this problem we propose a new data structure which is fully automatic since it does not require the user to determine any input parameters. The structure is built by first filtering the input objects by size, subsequently applying a clustering step to objects of the same size and finally building a hierarchy of uniform grids . We then show that this data structure can be efficiently constructed. The implementation of the shows that the new structure is stable since it's memory requirements grow linearly with the size of the scene, and that it presents a satisfactory compromise between memory usage and computational efficiency. A detailed comparison with previous data structures is also presented in the results.},

  abstract = {Abstract The focus of research in acceleration structures for ray tracing recently shifted from render time to time to image, the sum of build time and render time, and also the memory footprint of acceleration structures now receives more attention. In this paper we revisit the grid acceleration structure in this setting. We present two efficient methods for representing and building a grid. The compact grid method consists of a static data structure for representing a grid with minimal memory requirements, more specifically exactly one index per grid cell and exactly one index per object reference, and an algorithm for building that data structure in linear time. The hashed grid method reduces memory requirements even further, by using perfect hashing based on row displacement compression. We show that these methods are more efficient in both time and space than traditional methods based on linked lists and dynamic arrays. We also present a more robust grid traversal algorithm. We show that, for applications where time to image or memory usage is important, such as interactive ray tracing and rendering large models, the grid acceleration structure is an attractive alternative.},

                by computer. By using an extension of traditional structure information, or a geometric
                hierarchy, five significant improvements to current techniques are possible. First,
                the range of complexity of an environment is greatly increased while the visible complexity
                of any given scene is kept within a fixed upper limit. Second, a meaningful way is
                provided to vary the amount of detail presented in a scene. Third, “clipping” becomes
                a very fast logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment within
                the field of view. Fourth, frame to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical
                “working set,” or fraction of the total structure that should be present in primary
                store for immediate access by the visible surface algorithm. Finally, the geometric

  abstract  = {Hierarchical representations of 3-dimensional objects are both time and space efficient.
               They typically consist of trees whose branches represent bounding volumes and whose
               terminal nodes represent primitive object elements (usually polygons). This paper
               describes a method whereby the object space is represented entirely by a hierarchical
               data structure consisting of bounding volumes, with no other form of representation.
               This homogencity allows the visible surface rendering to be performed simply and efficiently.The
               bounding volumes selected for this algorithm are parallelepipeds oriented to minimize
               their size. With this representation, any surface can be rendered since in the limit
               the bounding volumes make up a point representation of the object. The advantage is
               that the visibility calculations consist only of a search through the data structure
               to determine the correspondence between terminal level bounding volumes and the current
               pixel. For ray tracing algorithms, this means that a simplified operation will produce
               the point of intersection of each ray with the bounding volumes.Memory requirements
               are minimized by expanding or fetching the lower levels of the hierarchy only when
               required. Because the viewing process has a single operation and primitive type, the
               software or hardware chosen to implement the search can be highly optimized for very
               fast execution.},

  abstract  = {A ray cast algorithm utilizing a hierarchical acceleration structure needs to perform
               a tree traversal in the hierarchy. In its basic form, executing the traversal requires
               a stack that holds the nodes that are still to be processed. In some cases, such a
               stack can be prohibitively expensive to maintain or access, due to storage or memory
               bandwidth limitations. The stack can, however, be eliminated or replaced with a fixed-size
               buffer using so-called stackless or short stack algorithms. These require that the
               traversal can be restarted from root so that the already processed part of the tree
               is not entered again. For kd-tree ray casts, this is accomplished easily by ray shortening,
               but the approach does not extend to other kinds of hierarchies such as BVHs.In this
               paper, we introduce restart trail, a simple algorithmic method that makes restarts
               possible regardless of the type of hierarchy by storing one bit of data per level.
               This enables stackless and short stack traversal for BVH ray casts, where using a
               full stack or constraining the traversal order have so far been the only options.},

  abstract  = {Bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) are a popular acceleration structure choice for
               animated scenes rendered with ray tracing. This is due to the relative simplicity
               of refitting bounding volumes around moving geometry. However, the quality of such
               a refitted tree can degrade rapidly if objects in the scene deform or rearrange significantly
               as the animation progresses, resulting in dramatic increases in rendering times and
               a commensurate reduction in the frame rate. The BVH could be rebuilt on every frame,
               but this could take significant time. We present a method to efficiently extend refitting
               for animated scenes with tree rotations, a technique previously proposed for off-line
               improvement of BVH quality for static scenes. Tree rotations are local restructuring
               operations which can mitigate the effects that moving primitives have on BVH quality
               by rearranging nodes in the tree during each refit rather than triggering a full rebuild.
               The result is a fast, lightweight, incremental update algorithm that requires negligible
               memory, has minor update times, parallelizes easily, avoids significant degradation
               in tree quality or the need for rebuilding, and maintains fast rendering times. We
               show that our method approaches or exceeds the frame rates of other techniques and
               is consistently among the best options regardless of the animated scene.},

We perform selective updates of the hierarchy driven by the cost model derived from the surface area heuristic. In each step, the algorithm updates a fraction of the hierarchy nodes to minimize the overall hierarchy cost. The updates are realized by simple operations on the tree nodes: removal, search and insertion. Our method can quickly reduce the cost of the hierarchy constructed by the traditional techniques, such as the surface area heuristic. We evaluate the properties of the proposed method on fourteen test scenes of different complexity including individual objects and architectural scenes. The results show that our method can improve a BVH initially constructed with the surface area heuristic by up to 27\% and a BVH constructed with the spatial median split by up to 88\%.},

               Recently, bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) have become the preferred acceleration
               structures, due to their competitive performance and greater flexibility compared
               to KD trees. In this paper, we present a study on algorithms for the construction
               of optimal BVHs.Due to the exponential nature of the problem, constructing optimal
               BVHs for ray tracing remains an open topic. By exploiting the linearity of the surface
               area heuristic (SAH), we develop an algorithm that can find optimal partitions in
               polynomial time. We further generalize this algorithm and show that every SAH-based
               KD tree or BVH construction algorithm is a special case of the generic algorithm.Based
               on a number of experiments with the generic algorithm, we conclude that the assumption
               of non-terminating rays in the surface area cost model becomes a major obstacle for
               using the full potential of BVHs. We also observe that enforcing space partitioning
               helps to improve BVH performance. Finally, we develop a simple space partitioning
               algorithm for building efficient BVHs.},

Our approach does not make any assumptions about the cache parameters or block sizes of the memory hierarchy. We introduce a new probabilistic model to predict the runtime access patterns of a BVH. Our layout computation algorithm utilizes parent-child and spatial localities between the accessed nodes to reduce both the number of cache misses and the size of the working set. Our algorithm also works well for spatial partitioning hierarchies including kd-trees. We use our algorithm to compute layouts of BVHs and spatial partitioning hierarchies of large models composed of millions of triangles. We compare our cache-efficient layouts with other layouts in the context of collision detection and ray tracing. In our benchmarks, our layouts consistently show better performance over other layouts and improve the performance of these applications by 26\%–300\%without any modification of the underlying algorithms or runtime applications.

               guide to the components of efficient real-time collision detection systems. The book
               provides the tools and know-how needed to implement industrial-strength collision
               detection for the highly detailed dynamic environments of applications such as 3D
               games, virtual reality applications, and physical simulators.Of the many topics covered,
               a key focus is on spatial and object partitioning through a wide variety of grids,
               trees, and sorting methods. The author also presents a large collection of intersection
               and distance tests for both simple and complex geometric shapes. Sections on vector
               and matrix algebra provide the background for advanced topics such as Voronoi regions,
               Minkowski sums, and linear and quadratic programming.Of utmost importance to programmers
               but rarely discussed in this much detail in other books are the chapters covering
               numerical and geometric robustness, both essential topics for collision detection
               systems. Also unique are the chapters discussing how graphics hardware can assist
               in collision detection computations and on advanced optimization for modern computer
               architectures. All in all, this comprehensive book will become the industry standard

  abstract = {Abstract We present two novel parallel algorithms for rapidly constructing bounding volume hierarchies on manycore GPUs. The first uses a linear ordering derived from spatial Morton codes to build hierarchies extremely quickly and with high parallel scalability. The second is a top-down approach that uses the surface area heuristic (SAH) to build hierarchies optimized for fast ray tracing. Both algorithms are combined into a hybrid algorithm that removes existing bottlenecks in the algorithm for GPU construction performance and scalability leading to significantly decreased build time. The resulting hierarchies are close in to optimized SAH hierarchies, but the construction process is substantially faster, leading to a significant net benefit when both construction and traversal cost are accounted for. Our preliminary results show that current GPU architectures can compete with CPU implementations of hierarchy construction running on multicore systems. In practice, we can construct hierarchies of models with up to several million triangles and use them for fast ray tracing or other applications.},

Traversal algorithms using cross links between nodes are presented as generalizations of ropes in octrees. Simulations of the surface area heuristic and the cross link scheme are presented.

  abstract  = {Publisher Summary
               In order to speed up the intersection calculation in ray-tracing programs, people have implemented divide-and-conquer strategies such as hierarchical bounding volumes and octrees. Uniform subdivision has also been used to speed up that calculation. Uniform subdivision is undesirable for applications where the objects may be unevenly distributed in space. This is because the amount of memory needed for uniform subdivision is proportional to the highest density of objects, rather than the total number. Hierarchical-bounding volumes can be difficult to implement effectively but can be used to good effect. Hierarchical space subdivision techniques do not suffer the memory problems of uniform subdivision and are also relatively easy to implement. This chapter discusses the best overall hierarchical subdivision technique currently known. There are two basic modules in a BSP tree intersection code. The first module builds the tree by recursively cutting the bounding box of all objects along a median spatial plane. The second module tracks a ray through the leaf nodes of the BSP tree checking for intersections. The BSP tree is built by InitBinTree( ) and Subdivide( ). RayTreeIntersect( ) is the actual tree walking traversal of the BSP tree following a ray.}

  abstract = {Abstract Compared with its competitors such as the bounding volume hierarchy, a drawback of the kd-tree structure is that a large number of triangles are repeatedly duplicated during its construction, which often leads to inefficient, large and tall binary trees with high triangle redundancy. In this paper, we propose a space-efficient kd-tree representation where, unlike commonly used methods, an inner node is allowed to optionally store a reference to a triangle, so highly redundant triangles in a kd-tree can be culled from the leaf nodes and moved to the inner nodes. To avoid the construction of ineffective kd-trees entailing computational inefficiencies due to early, possibly unnecessary, ray-triangle intersection calculations that now have to be performed in the inner nodes during the kd-tree traversal, we present heuristic measures for determining when and how to choose triangles for inner nodes during kd-tree construction. Based on these metrics, we describe how the new form of kd-tree is constructed and stored compactly using a carefully designed data layout. Our experiments with several example scenes showed that our kd-tree representation technique significantly reduced the memory requirements for storing the kd-tree structure, while effectively suppressing the unavoidable frame-rate degradation observed during ray tracing.},

               used to organize primitives in a scene to allow efficient execution of intersection
               operations between rays and the primitives. The highest quality k-D tree can be obtained
               using greedy cost optimization based on a surface area heuristc (SAH). While the high
               quality enables very fast ray tracing times, a key drawback is that the k-D tree construction

  abstract  = {The surface area heuristic (SAH) is widely used as a predictor for ray tracing performance,
               and as a heuristic to guide the construction of spatial acceleration structures. We
               investigate how well SAH actually predicts ray tracing performance of a bounding volume
               hierarchy (BVH), observe that this relationship is far from perfect, and then propose
               two new metrics that together with SAH almost completely explain the measured performance.
               Our observations shed light on the increasingly common situation that a supposedly
               good tree construction algorithm produces trees that are slower to trace than expected.
               We also note that the trees constructed using greedy top-down algorithms are consistently
               faster to trace than SAH indicates and are also more SIMD-friendly than competing
               approaches.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper we present a hybrid algorithm for building the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) that is used in accelerating ray tracing of animated models. This algorithm precomputes densely packed clusters of triangles on surfaces. Folowing that, a set of clusters is used to rebuild the BVH in every frame. Our approach utilizes the assumption that groups of connected triangles remain connected throughout the course of the animation. We introduce a novel heuristic to create triangle clusters that are designed for high performance ray tracing. This heuristic combines the density of connectivity, geometric size and the shape of the cluster. Our approach accelerates the BVH builder by an order of magnitude rebuilding only the set of clusters that is much smaller than the original set of triangles. The speed-up is achieved against a ‘brute-force’ BVH builder that repartitions all triangles in every frame of animation without using any pre-clustering. The rendering performance is not affected when a cluster contains a few dozen triangles. We demonstrate the real-time/interactive ray tracing performance for highly-dynamic complex models.},

A constrained tetrahedralization of a scene is a tetrahedralization that respects the faces of the scene geometry. The closest intersection of a ray with a scene is found by traversing this tetrahedralization along the ray, one tetrahedron at a time. We show that constrained tetrahedralizations are a viable alternative to current acceleration structures, and that they have a number of unique properties that set them apart from other acceleration structures: constrained tetrahedralizations are not hierarchical yet adaptive; the complexity of traversing them is a function of local geometric complexity rather than global geometric complexity; constrained tetrahedralizations support deforming geometry without any effort; and they have the potential to unify several data structures currently used in global illumination.},

In this paper an alternative index structure called spatial kd-tree is proposed to facilitate the processing of queries concerning geographic information. The spatial kd-tree partitions a set of records on two dimensional space into small groups based on their spatial proximity. The structure not only provides efficient retrieval of objects but also maintains high storage efficiency.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a new spatial index structure, called Bounded KD tree (B-KD
               tree), for realtime ray tracing of dynamic scenes. By presenting hardware units of
               all time critical B-KD tree algorithms in the context of a custom realtime ray tracing
               chip we show that this spatial index structure is well suited for hardware implementation.
               B-KD trees are a hybrid spatial index structure that combine the advantages of KD
               trees and Bounding Volume Hierarchies into a single, simple to handle spatial index
               structure. Similar to KD trees, B-KD trees are binary trees where each node considers
               only a single spatial dimension. However, instead of a single splitting plane that
               divides space into two disjoint sub-spaces, each node in B-KD trees contains two pairs
               of axis aligned planes that bound the geometry of its two child nodes. As a bounding
               volume approach B-KD trees allow for simple and efficient updates when changing geometry
               while maintaining the fast traversal operations and simple hardware implementation
               known from KD trees. This enables the support for dynamic scenes with constant mesh
               topology and coherent dynamic changes, like typical skinned meshes.Our hardware architecture
               contains several fixed-function units that completely handle skinning, updating, and
               ray tracing of dynamic scenes using B-KD trees. An FPGA prototype of this architecture
               already delivers realtime performance of up to 35 frames per second even when clocked

               Similar to bounding volume hierarchies the memory of the acceleration data structure
               is linear in the number of objects to be ray traced and can be predicted prior to
               construction, while the traversal of the hierarchy is as efficient as the one of kd-trees.
               The construction algorithm can be considered a variant of quicksort and for the first
               time is based on a global space partitioning heuristic, which is much cheaper to evaluate
               than the classic surface area heuristic. Compared to spatial partitioning schemes
               only a fraction of the memory is used and a higher numerical precision is intrinsic.
               The new method is simple to implement and its high performance is demonstrated by
               extensive measurements including massive as well as dynamic scenes, where we focus
               on the total time to image including the construction cost rather than on only frames

  abstract  = {The relationship between Maxwell's equations and radiative-transport theory is studied for isotropic, nondispersive media that have arbitrary permittivity variations. It is demonstrated that the postulates of transport theory are consistent with Maxwell's equations if the characteristics of the medium and the fields are such that the field-correlation tensor possesses certain properties and if the relative permittivity fluctuations in the medium are small in comparison with unity and have correlation lengths that satisfy appropriate requirements.}

  abstract  = {Perceptually uniform color spaces can be a useful tool for solving computer graphics color selection problems. However, before they can be used effectively some basic principles of tristimulus colorimetry must be understood and the color reproduction device on which they are to be used must be properly adjusted. The Munsell Book of Color and the Optical Society of America (OSA) Uniform Color Scale are two uniform color spaces which provide a useful way of organizing the colors of a digitally controlled color television monitor. The perceptual uniformity of these color spaces can be used to select color scales to encode the variations of parameters such as temperature or stress.},

  abstract   = {Accurate simulation of light propagation within an environment and perceptually based imaging techniques are necessary for the creation of realistic images. A physical experiment that verifies the simulation of reflected light intensities for diffuse environments was conducted. Measurements of radiant energy flux densities are compared with predictions using the radiosity method for those physical environments. By using color science procedures the results of the light model simulation are then transformed to produce a color television image. The final image compares favorably with the original physical model. The experiment indicates that, when the physical model and the simulation were viewed through a view camera, subjects could not distinguish between them. The results and comparison of both test procedures are presented within this paper.},
