  abstract  = {From the Publisher:This new text examines the design and implementation of Icc, a production-quality, retargetable compiler, designed at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and Princeton University for the ANSI C programming language. The authors' innovative approach - a "literate program" that intermingles the text with the source code - gives a detailed tour of the code that explains the implementation and design decisions reflected in the software. And while most books describe toy compilers or focus on isolated pieces of code, the authors have made available the entire source code for a real compiler. Structured as a self-study guide that describes the real-world tradeoffs encountered in building a production-quality compiler, A Retargetable C Compiler is also useful to individuals who work in application areas using or creating language-based tools and techniques. Features: discusses the implementation and design tradeoffs made while constructing a real ANSI C compiler, illustrating the interaction between theory and practice; covers compiler theory only as needed to understand the implementation of Icc, focusing instead on practical, applied issues; encourages a deeper understanding of programming in C, by providing C programmers with a tour of the language from the perspective of compiler authors; includes coverage of code generators for the MIPS R3000, SPARC, and Intel 386 and its successors; and provides access to the full source code for the Icc compiler, the three back ends, and the code-generator generator, either on disk or via FTP.}

In a simplified form, this information is stored in a tree of “rays” extending from the viewer to the first surface encountered and from there to other surfaces and to the light sources. A visible surface algorithm creates this tree for each pixel of the display and passes it to the shader. The shader then traverses the tree to determine the intensity of the light received by the viewer. Consideration of all of these factors allows the shader to accurately simulate true reflection, shadows, and refraction, as well as the effects simulated by conventional shaders. Anti-aliasing is included as an integral part of the visibility calculations. Surfaces displayed include curved as well as polygonal surfaces.},

Current light reflection models used in computer graphics do not account for the object-to-object reflection between diffuse surfaces, and thus incorrectly compute the global illumination effects. The new procedure, based on methods used in thermal engineering, includes the effects of diffuse light sources of finite area, as well as the “color-bleeding” effects which are caused by the diffuse reflections. A simple environment is used to illustrate these simulated effects and is presented with photographs of a physical model. The procedure is applicable to environments composed of ideal diffuse reflectors and can account for direct illumination from a variety of light sources. The resultant surface intensities are independent of observer position, and thus environments can be preprocessed for dynamic sequences.},

In essence, each object in the environment is treated as a secondary light source. The method provides an accurate representation of the "diffuse" and "ambient" terms found in typical image synthesis algorithms. The phenomena of "color bleeding" from one surface to another, shading within shadow envelopes, and penumbras along shadow boundaries are accurately reproduced. Additional advantages result because computations are indepedent of viewer position. This allows the efficient rendering of multiple views of the same scene for dynamic sequences. Light sources can be modulated and object reflectivities can be changed, with minimal extra computation. The procedures extend the radiosity method beyond the bounds previously imposed.},

Many phenomena that are difficult or impossible with other techniques are simple with ray tracing, including shadows, reflections, and refracted light. Ray directions, however, have been determined precisely, and this has limited the capabilities of ray tracing. By distributing the directions of the rays according to the analytic function they sample, ray tracing can incorporate fuzzy phenomena. This provides correct and easy solutions to some previously unsolved or partially solved problems, including motion blur, depth of field, penumbras, translucency, and fuzzy reflections. Motion blur and depth of field calculations can be integrated with the visible surface calculations, avoiding the problems found in previous methods. },

Consequently, many of the powerful techniques which have been developed in these fields can be applied to problems in image synthesis. In this paper we adapt several statistical techniques commonly used in neutron transport to stochastic ray tracing and, more generally, to Monte Carlo solution of the rendering equation. First, we describe a technique known as Russian roulette which can be used to terminate the recursive tracing of rays without introducing statistical bias. We also examine the practice of creating ray trees in classical ray tracing in the light of a well-known technique in particle transport known as splitting. We show that neither ray trees nor paths as described in [10] constitute an optimal sampling plan in themselves and that a hybrid may be more efficient.},

This bias is dependent upon the image function being sampled as well as the strategy for determining the number of samples to use. It is most prominent in areas of high contrast and is attributable to early stages of sampling systematically favoring one extreme or the other. If the expected outcome of the entire adaptive sampling algorithm is considered, we find that the bias of the early decisions is still present in the final estimator. We propose an alternative strategy for performing adaptive sampling that is unbiased but potentially more costly. We conclude that it may not always be practical to mitigate this source of bias, but as a source of error it should be considered when high accuracy and image fidelity are a central concern.},

  abstract    = {Realistic image generation is presented in a theoretical formulation that builds from previous work on the rendering equation. Previous and new solution techniques for the global illumination are discussed in the context of this formulation. The physical rules governing reflection are used to make improvements in local reflection models. The conventional local illumination models used in computer graphics are examined and modified to be consistent with these physical rules.Global illumination is treated in terms of evaluation of a Global Radiance Function. Image-based solution methods are phrased as a lazy evaluation of the Global Radiance Function; evaluation takes place for visible points. Zonal solution methods are phrased as table based solutions. A proof is given that, subject to certain constraints, only O(N) rays are required for a zonal solution with N zones. Simulation allows for surfaces which are not zoned to interact with those that are.The ray tracing zonal solution methods used for surfaces are extended to scenes with participating media. The impact of wavelength selection and time dependencies is also discussed.An object oriented implementation is discussed. This implementation separates the local and global illumination modules, so all of the specifics of the local models are hidden from the global energy transport code. This allows new local modules to be added by specifying the black box access routines.},

  abstract  = {From the Publisher:Image synthesis, or rendering, is a field of transformation: it changes geometry and physics into meaningful images. Because the most popular algorithms frequently change, it is increasingly important for researchers and implementors to have a basic understanding of the principles of image synthesis. Focusing on theory, Andrew Glassner provides a comprehensive explanation of the three core fields of study that come together to form digital image synthesis: the human visual system, digital signal processing, and the interaction of matter and light. Assuming no more than a basic background in calculus, Glassner transforms his passion and expertise into a thorough presentation of each of these disciplines, and their elegant orchestration into modern rendering techniques such as radiosity and ray tracing.}

The simulation uses a light-backwards ray-tracing method with extensions to efficiently solve the rendering equation under most conditions. This includes specular, diffuse and directional-diffuse reflection and transmission in any combination to any level in any environment, including complicated, curved geometries. The simulation blends deterministic and stochastic ray-tracing techniques to achieve the best balance between speed and accuracy in its local and global illumination methods. Some of the more interesting techniques are outlined, with references to more detailed descriptions elsewhere. Finally, examples are given of successful applications of this free software by others.},

  abstract  = {Some applications of computer graphics require a vivid illusion of reality. These include the spatial organization of machine parts, conceptual architectural design, simulation of mechanisms, and industrial design. There has been moderate success in the automatic generation of wire frame, cardboard model, polyhedra, and quadric surface line drawings. The capability of the machine to generate vivid sterographic pictures has been demonstrated. There are, however considerable reasons for developing techniques by which line drawings of solids can be shaded, especially the enhancement of the sense of solidity and depth. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the value of shading and shadow casting in spatial description. In the line drawing there is no clue as to the relative position of the flat plane and the sheet metal console. When shadows are rendered, it is clear that the plane is below and to the rear of the console, and the hollow nature of the sheet metal assembly is emphasized. Shading can specify the tone or color of a surface and the amount of light falling upon that surface from one or more light sources. Shadows when sharply defined tend to suggest another viewpoint and improves surface definition. When controlled, shading can also emphasize particular parts of the drawing. If techniques for the automatic determination of chiaroscuro with good resolution should prove to be competitive with line drawings, and this is a possibility, machine generated photographs might replace line drawings as the principal mode of graphical communication in engineering and architecture.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a visual simulation technique by which fully computer-generated perspective views of three-dimensional objects may be produced. The method is based on a relatively simple geometric modeling technique for the mathematical representa tion of the three elements essential to the picture- taking process, namely, a camera, a light source, and the object or objects to be photographed. Once these three basic components have been defined, geometric ray tracing is employed to compute a "picture" of the object as it appears in the simu- Zated camera. In essence, individual light rays are traced from their source to the surface of the object. The reflected component of each ray is computed and traced to its point of intersection with the film plane. Thus, each reflected ray pro vides the intensity at a single point on the pic ture, and, when a sufficient number of points have been computed, the entire area of intensity data may be displayed on a cathode ray tube. Several examples of the pictorial output of this process are shown, and the application to the computer- generated films is discussed. }

  abstract  = {Simple transparency algorithms which assume a linear transparency over an entire surface are the type most often employed to produce computer synthesized images of transparent objects with curved surfaces. Although most of the images created with these algorithms do give the impression of transparency, they usually do not look realistic. One of the most serious problems is that the intensity of the light that is transmitted through the objects is generally not proportional to the amount of material through which it must pass. Another problem is that the image seen behind the objects is not distorted as would naturally occur when the light is refracted as it passes through a material of different density.Use of a non-linear transparency algorithm can provide a great improvement in the realism of an image at a small additional cost. Making the transparency proportional to the normal to the surface causes it to decrease towards the edges of the surface where the path of the light through the object is longer. The exact simulation of refraction, however, requires that each sight ray be individually traced from the observer, through the picture plane and through each transparent object until an opaque surface is intersected. Since the direction of the ray would change as each material of differing optical density was entered, the hidden surface calculations required would be very time consuming. However, if a few assumptions are made about the geometry of each object and about the conditions under which they are viewed, a much simplier algorithm can be used to approximate the refractive effect. This method proceeds in a back to front order, mapping the current background image onto the next surface, until all surfaces have been considered.},

But users are hampered by the lack of authoritative, up-to-date information on applying the standard, having long had to rely on the ten-year-old RenderMan Companion and a far-flung collection of course notes and Web sites. Advanced RenderMan: Beyond the Companion is precisely what RenderMan users are dying for. It offers thoroughly updated coverage while moving beyond the original work's scope to provide in-depth information on dozens of advanced topics. Both a reference and a tutorial, this book will be indispensable to graphics programmers, modelers, animators, technical directors, and hobbyists-it is truly the key to their ability to achieve state-of-the-art 3D effects. Key Features: Written by the world's foremost RenderMan experts-key figures at Pixar, the company that developed and first implemented the standard Offers advanced users instruction not available anywhere else while providing a leg up to relative beginners-including tips on avoiding mistakes and an appendix covering key math skills. Filled with technical illustrations and many full-color representations of effects supported by the RenderMan standard Via a companion Web site, provides comprehensive documentation of the standard's semantics and syntax, example source code, shaders and other software, and the full set of SIGGRAPH course notes on RenderMan}

               This chapter describes the quaternions and 4 x 4 matrices. Quaternions are steadily replacing Euler angles as the internal representation of orientations. They mesh remarkably well with 4 × 4 homogeneous matrices. Matrix multiplication can be used quite nicely for quaternion multiplication, because quaternions are, in fact, four-component homogeneous coordinates for orientations, and because they multiply linearly. A quaternion q as a 4-vector, written as (xq, yq, zq, wq), or as just (x, y, z, w) is described. Some systems do not implement matrix manipulations carefully, and will misbehave if the bottom right entry of the matrix is not 1. Even when normalization is desired, it is not necessary to compute a square root and only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are used. It is found that only the last row and column of the two matrices differ, and then only by transposition or sign change.}

  abstract  = {Solid bodies roll and tumble through space. In computer animation, so do cameras. The rotations of these objects are best described using a four coordinate system, quaternions, as is shown in this paper. Of all quaternions, those on the unit sphere are most suitable for animation, but the question of how to construct curves on spheres has not been much explored. This paper gives one answer by presenting a new kind of spline curve, created on a sphere, suitable for smoothly in-betweening (i.e. interpolating) sequences of arbitrary rotations. Both theory and experiment show that the motion generated is smooth and natural, without quirks found in earlier methods.},

Yet illicit expressions containing terms like P + Q, cP, P X Q, etc. often appear in graphics textbooks, papers, and programs. In this paper we justify the use of such illicit expressions, and we we give criteria for recognizing when such an expression is truly legitimate. In particular we show that an algebraic expression E (P1, …, Pn) is legitimate if and only if E(v1 +  w, …vn + w) = E(v1, …, vn) + kw, k + 0, 1. We also derive many useful examples of such an expression.},

We prove existence and uniqueness properties of the weighted averages, and give fast iterative algorithms with linear and quadratic convergence rates. Our methods are appropriate to problems involving averages of spherical data in meteorological, geophysical, and astronomical applications. One simple application is a method for smooth averaging of quaternions, which generalizes Shoemake's spherical linear interpolation.The weighted averages methods allow a novel method of defining B\'{e}zier and spline curves on spheres, which provides direct generalization of B\'{e}zier and B-spline curves to spherical spline curves. We present a fast algorithm for spline interpolation on spheres. Our spherical splines allow the use of arbitrary knot positions; potential applications of spherical splines include smooth quaternion curves for applications in graphics, animation, robotics, and motion planning.},

The method can be used in a variety of applications such as reverse engineering—the automatic generation of CAD models from physical objects. Novel aspects of the method are its ability to model surfaces of arbitrary topological type and to recover sharp features such as creases and corners. The method has proven to be effective, as demonstrated by a number of examples using both simulated and real data.A key ingredient in the method, and a principal contribution of this paper, is the introduction of a new class of piecewise smooth surface representations based on subdivision. These surfaces have a number of properties that make  them ideal for use in surface reconstruction: they are simple to implement, they can model sharp features concisely, and they can be fit to scattered range data using an unconstrained optimization procedure.},

  doi          = {10.18725/OPARU-974},
  abstractnote = {Photorealistic image synthesis can be described by a path integral. This integral is numerically approximated by summing up contributions of transport paths that connect light sources and sensors like e.g. a camera or the eye. The paths are trajectories of Markov processes, whose edges are straight lines along rays of light and whose vertices are light scattering events. The goal of this thesis was to accelerate the simulation of light transport, to find new algorithms and data structures to efficiently trace rays, and to better approximate the distribution of light by simultaneously simulating an ensemble of paths instead of single trajectories, using quasi-Monte-Carlo methods. We first present new data structures and heuristics that feature a smaller memory footprint at improved numerical precision. In addition it is possible to ray trace even massive scenes in a strictly limited, a priori fixed, memory block using rapid construction techniques that allow to rebuild the complete data structure at interactive frame rates. All efforts were combined in a unified framework that further allows one to build the acceleration hierarchy using an on demand policy and optionally balance the construction time versus the ray intersection time. Besides finding faster ray tracing algorithms, the total number of rays to be shot was reduced by mathematical means. By simplifying complicated mathematical schemes in a non-obvious way, the time complexity of the quasi-Monte-Carlo simulation process was reduced. When concentrating on the fact that the underlying Fredholm integral equation is in fact of low dimensional structure if not solved by the Neumann series, the resulting algorithms are simpler and in addition much more efficient. The combination of these new techniques allows photorealistic image synthesis in almost realtime. The results are demonstrated by several academic and industrial applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract Existing techniques for rendering arbitrary-form implicit surfaces are limited, either in performance, correctness or flexibility. Ray tracing algorithms employing interval arithmetic (IA) or affine arithmetic (AA) for root-funding are robust and general in the class of surfaces they support, but traditionally slow. Nonetheless, implemented efficiently using a stack-driven iterative algorithm and SIMD vector instructions, these methods can achieve interactive performance for common algebraic surfaces on the CPU. A similar algorithm can also be implemented stacklessly, allowing for efficient ray tracing on the GPU. This paper presents these algorithms, as well as an inclusion-preserving reduced affine arithmetic (RAA) for faster ray-surface intersection. Shader metaprogramming allows for immediate and automatic generation of symbolic expressions and their interval or affine extensions. Moreover, we are able to render even complex forms robustly, in real-time at high resolution.},

                natural irregular objects and phenomena without undue time or space overhead. We develop
                a new and powerful solution to this computer graphics problem by modeling objects
                as sample paths of stochastic processes. Of particular interest are those stochastic
                processes which previously have been found to be useful models of the natural phenomena
                to be represented. One such model applicable to the representation of terrains, known
                as “fractional Brownian motion,” has been developed by Mandelbrot.The value of a new
                approach to object modeling in computer graphics depends largely on the efficiency
                of the techniques used to implement the model. We introduce a new algorithm that computes
                a realistic, visually satisfactory approximation to fractional Brownian motion in
                faster time than with exact calculations. A major advantage of this technique is that
                it allows us to compute the surface to arbitrary levels of details without increasing
                the database. Thus objects with complex appearances can be displayed from a very small
                database. The character of the surface can be controlled by merely modifying a few
                parameters. A similar change allows complex motion to be created inexpensively.},

The problem of reporting wrong intersections, inherent to the original Bézier clipping algorithm14 , is inves-tigated and opposed to the triangular case. It turns out that reporting wrong hits is very improbable, even close to impossible, in the triangular set-up. A combination of Bézier clipping and a simple hierarchy of nested bounding volumes offers a reliable and accurate solution to the problem of ray tracing triangular Bézier patches.},

               Given that the mesh is accessed in a reasonably coherent manner, we assume no particular
               data access patterns or cache parameters of the memory hierarchy involved in the computation.
               Furthermore, our formulation extends directly to computing layouts of multi-resolution

               cache-oblivious metric for estimating cache misses. Computing a coherent mesh layout
               is reduced to a combinatorial optimization problem. We designed and implemented an
               out-of-core multilevel minimization algorithm and tested its performance on unstructured
               meshes composed of tens to hundreds of millions of triangles. Our layouts can significantly

                defined by sweeping a two-dimensional contour along a three-dimensional trajectory.
                The contour can be any 'well-behaved' curve in the sense that it is continuous, and
                that the points where the tangent is horizontal or vertical can be determined, the
                trajectory can be any spline curve. First a definition is given of generalized cylinders
                in terms of the Frenet frame of the trajectory. Then the main problem in ray tracing
                these objects, the computation of the intersection points with a ray, is reduced to
                the problem of intersecting two two-dimensional curves. This problem is solved by
                a subdivision algorithm. The three-dimensional normal at the intersection point closest
                to the eye point, necessary to perform shading, is obtained by transforming the two-dimensional
                normal at the corresponding intersection point of the two two-dimensional curves.

The method is presented as a generalization of a recursive bicubic B-spline patch subdivision algorithm. For rectangular control-point meshes, the method generates a standard B-spline surface. For non-rectangular meshes, it generates surfaces that are shown to reduce to a standard B-spline surface except at a small number of points, called extraordinary points. Therefore, everywhere except at these points the surface is continuous in tangent and curvature. At the extraordinary points, the pictures of the surface indicate that the surface is at least continuous in tangent, but no proof of continuity is given. A similar algorithm for biquadratic B-splines is also presented.}

  abstract = {Abstract Subdivision Surfaces as well as (interactive) ray tracing have become an important issue in computer graphics.But ray tracing of subdivision surfaces has received only little attention. We present a new approach for raytracing of subdivision surfaces. The algorithm uses a projection of the ray onto the surface and works mainly intwo dimensions along this projection. While proceeding from patch to patch, we examine the bounding volume oftheir borders: the lower the distance between ray and subdivision surface, the more refinement steps are adaptivelyapplied to the surface but only along the projection of the ray. The adaptive refinement of a patch is controlled bycurvature, size, its membership to the silhouette, and its potential contribution to the light transport. The algorithmis simple and mainly consists of elementary geometric computations. Hence it is fast and easy to implementwithout the need for elaborate preprocessing. The algorithm is robust in the sense that it deals with all features ofsubdivision surfaces like creases and corners.

               smooth, free-form surfaces is attractive for content destined for display on devices

               detail rendering and powerful compression algorithms. While the underlying algorithms
               are conceptually simple it is difficult to implement player engines which achieve

               we describe a novel table driven evaluation strategy for subdivision surfaces using
               as an example the scheme of Catmull and Clark. Cache conscious design and exploitation
               of SIMD instructions allows us to achieve nearly 100\% FPU utilization in the inner

               flop/cycle on the Intel P4 including all memory transfers. The algorithm supports
               tradeoffs between cache size and memory bus usage which we examine. A library which
               implements this engine is freely available from the authors.},

               subdivision surfaces entirely on programmable graphics hardware. Our scheme extends
               the concept of breadth-first subdivision, which up to this point has only been applied
               to parametric patches. While mesh representations designed for a CPU often involve
               pointer-based structures and irregular perelement storage, neither of these is well-suited

  abstract   = {Gappa is a tool designed to formally verify the correctness of numerical software
                and hardware. It uses interval arithmetic and forward error analysis to bound mathematical
                expressions that involve rounded as well as exact operators. It then generates a theorem
                and its proof for each verified enclosure. This proof can be automatically checked
                with a proof assistant, such as Coq or HOL Light. It relies on a large companion library
                of facts that we have developed. This Coq library provides theorems dealing with addition,
                multiplication, division, and square root, for both fixed- and floating-point arithmetics.
                Gappa uses multiple-precision dyadic fractions for the endpoints of intervals and
                performs forward error analysis on rounded operators when necessary. When asked, Gappa
                reports the best bounds it is able to reach for a given expression in a given context.
                This feature can be used to identify where the set of facts and automatic techniques
                implemented in Gappa becomes insufficient. Gappa handles seamlessly additional properties

Solid objects are modeled by combining primitive solids, such as blocks and cylinders, using the set operators union, intersection, and difference. To visualize and analyze the composite solids modeled, virtual light rays are cast as probes. By virtue of its simplicity, ray casting is reliable and extensible. The most difficult mathematical problem is finding line-surface intersection points. So surfaces such as planes, quadrics, tori, and probably even parametric surface patches may bound the primitive solids. The adequacy and efficiency of ray casting are issues addressed here. A fast picture generation capability for interactive modeling is the biggest challenge. New methods are presented, accompanied by sample pictures and CPU times, to meet the challenge.}

Designers often want the added flexibility of having both quads and triangles in their models. It is also well known that triangle meshes generate poor limit surfaces when using a quad scheme, while quad-only meshes behave poorly with triangular schemes. Our new scheme is a generalization of the well known Catmull-Clark and Loop subdivision algorithms. We show that our surfaces are C 1 everywhere and provide a proof that it is impossible to construct such a C 2 scheme at the quad/triangle boundary.

               surfaces into high-quality, crack-free micropolygon meshes. DiagSplit modifies the
               split-dice tessellation algorithm to allow splits along non-isoparametric directions
               in the surface's parametric domain, and uses a dicing scheme that supports unique
               tessellation factors for each subpatch edge. Edge tessellation factors are computed
               using only information local to subpatch edges. These modifications allow all subpatches
               generated by DiagSplit to be processed independently without introducing T-junctions
               or mesh cracks and without incurring the tessellation overhead of binary dicing. We
               demonstrate that DiagSplit produces output that is better (in terms of image quality
               and number of micropolygons produced) than existing parallel tessellation schemes,
               and as good as highly adaptive split-dice implementations that are less amenable to
               parallelization.},

  abstract  = {Surface elements (surfels) are a powerful paradigm to efficiently render complex geometric
               objects at interactive frame rates. Unlike classical surface discretizations, i.e.,
               triangles or quadrilateral meshes, surfels are point primitives without explicit connectivity.
               Surfel attributes comprise depth, texture color, normal, and others. As a pre-process,
               an octree-based surfel representation of a geometric object is computed. During sampling,
               surfel positions and normals are optionally perturbed, and different levels of texture
               colors are prefiltered and stored per surfel. During rendering, a hierarchical forward
               warping algorithm projects surfels to a z-buffer. A novel method called visibility
               splatting determines visible surfels and holes in the z-buffer. Visible surfels are
               shaded using texture filtering, Phong illumination, and environment mapping using
               per-surfel normals. Several methods of image reconstruction, including supersampling,
               offer flexible speed-quality tradeoffs. Due to the simplicity of the operations, the
               surfel rendering pipeline is amenable for hardware implementation. Surfel objects
               offer complex shape, low rendering cost and high image quality, which makes them specifically
               suited for low-cost, real-time graphics, such as games.},

  abstract  = {Although fractal models of natural phenomena have received much attention recently,
               there are other models of complex natural objects which have been around longer in
               Computer Imagery but are not widely known. These are procedural models of plants and
               trees. An interesting class of these models is presented here which handles plant
               growth, sports an efficient data representation, and has a high “database amplification”
               factor. It is based on an extension of the well-known formal languages of symbol strings
               to the lesser-known formal languages of labeled graphs. It is so tempting to describe
               these plant models as “fractal” that the similarities of this class of models with
               fractal models are explored in an attempt at rapprochement. The models are not fractal
               so the common parts of fractal theory and plant theory are abstracted to form a class
               of objects, the graftals. This class may prove to be of great interest to the future
               of Computer Imagery. Determinism is shown to provide adequate complexity, whereas
               randomness is only convenient and often inefficient. Finally, a nonfractal, nongraftal
               family of trees by Bill Reeves is introduced to emphasize some of the paper's nongrammatical

It is often the case that an incorrect choice of these parameters can result in greedy memory requirements or severely degraded performance. As a remedy to this problem we propose a new data structure which is fully automatic since it does not require the user to determine any input parameters. The structure is built by first filtering the input objects by size, subsequently applying a clustering step to objects of the same size and finally building a hierarchy of uniform grids . We then show that this data structure can be efficiently constructed. The implementation of the shows that the new structure is stable since it's memory requirements grow linearly with the size of the scene, and that it presents a satisfactory compromise between memory usage and computational efficiency. A detailed comparison with previous data structures is also presented in the results.},

In this paper we revisit the grid acceleration structure in this setting. We present two efficient methods for representing and building a grid. The compact grid method consists of a static data structure for representing a grid with minimal memory requirements, more specifically exactly one index per grid cell and exactly one index per object reference, and an algorithm for building that data structure in linear time. The hashed grid method reduces memory requirements even further, by using perfect hashing based on row displacement compression. We show that these methods are more efficient in both time and space than traditional methods based on linked lists and dynamic arrays. We also present a more robust grid traversal algorithm. We show that, for applications where time to image or memory usage is important, such as interactive ray tracing and rendering large models, the grid acceleration structure is an attractive alternative.},

                a very fast logarithmic search for the resolvable parts of the environment within
                the field of view. Fourth, frame to frame coherence and clipping define a graphical

  abstract  = {Hierarchical representations of 3-dimensional objects are both time and space efficient.
               They typically consist of trees whose branches represent bounding volumes and whose
               terminal nodes represent primitive object elements (usually polygons). This paper
               describes a method whereby the object space is represented entirely by a hierarchical
               data structure consisting of bounding volumes, with no other form of representation.
               This homogencity allows the visible surface rendering to be performed simply and efficiently.The
               bounding volumes selected for this algorithm are parallelepipeds oriented to minimize
               their size. With this representation, any surface can be rendered since in the limit
               the bounding volumes make up a point representation of the object. The advantage is
               that the visibility calculations consist only of a search through the data structure
               to determine the correspondence between terminal level bounding volumes and the current
               pixel. For ray tracing algorithms, this means that a simplified operation will produce
               the point of intersection of each ray with the bounding volumes.Memory requirements
               are minimized by expanding or fetching the lower levels of the hierarchy only when
               required. Because the viewing process has a single operation and primitive type, the
               software or hardware chosen to implement the search can be highly optimized for very
               fast execution.},

  abstract  = {A ray cast algorithm utilizing a hierarchical acceleration structure needs to perform
               a tree traversal in the hierarchy. In its basic form, executing the traversal requires
               a stack that holds the nodes that are still to be processed. In some cases, such a
               stack can be prohibitively expensive to maintain or access, due to storage or memory
               bandwidth limitations. The stack can, however, be eliminated or replaced with a fixed-size
               buffer using so-called stackless or short stack algorithms. These require that the
               traversal can be restarted from root so that the already processed part of the tree
               is not entered again. For kd-tree ray casts, this is accomplished easily by ray shortening,
               but the approach does not extend to other kinds of hierarchies such as BVHs.In this
               paper, we introduce restart trail, a simple algorithmic method that makes restarts
               possible regardless of the type of hierarchy by storing one bit of data per level.
               This enables stackless and short stack traversal for BVH ray casts, where using a
               full stack or constraining the traversal order have so far been the only options.},

  abstract  = {Bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) are a popular acceleration structure choice for
               animated scenes rendered with ray tracing. This is due to the relative simplicity
               of refitting bounding volumes around moving geometry. However, the quality of such
               a refitted tree can degrade rapidly if objects in the scene deform or rearrange significantly
               as the animation progresses, resulting in dramatic increases in rendering times and
               a commensurate reduction in the frame rate. The BVH could be rebuilt on every frame,
               but this could take significant time. We present a method to efficiently extend refitting
               for animated scenes with tree rotations, a technique previously proposed for off-line
               improvement of BVH quality for static scenes. Tree rotations are local restructuring
               operations which can mitigate the effects that moving primitives have on BVH quality
               by rearranging nodes in the tree during each refit rather than triggering a full rebuild.
               The result is a fast, lightweight, incremental update algorithm that requires negligible
               memory, has minor update times, parallelizes easily, avoids significant degradation
               in tree quality or the need for rebuilding, and maintains fast rendering times. We
               show that our method approaches or exceeds the frame rates of other techniques and
               is consistently among the best options regardless of the animated scene.},

The updates are realized by simple operations on the tree nodes: removal, search and insertion. Our method can quickly reduce the cost of the hierarchy constructed by the traditional techniques, such as the surface area heuristic. We evaluate the properties of the proposed method on fourteen test scenes of different complexity including individual objects and architectural scenes. The results show that our method can improve a BVH initially constructed with the surface area heuristic by up to 27\% and a BVH constructed with the spatial median split by up to 88\%.},

               to KD trees. In this paper, we present a study on algorithms for the construction
               of optimal BVHs.Due to the exponential nature of the problem, constructing optimal
               BVHs for ray tracing remains an open topic. By exploiting the linearity of the surface
               area heuristic (SAH), we develop an algorithm that can find optimal partitions in
               polynomial time. We further generalize this algorithm and show that every SAH-based
               KD tree or BVH construction algorithm is a special case of the generic algorithm.Based
               on a number of experiments with the generic algorithm, we conclude that the assumption
               of non-terminating rays in the surface area cost model becomes a major obstacle for
               using the full potential of BVHs. We also observe that enforcing space partitioning
               helps to improve BVH performance. Finally, we develop a simple space partitioning
               algorithm for building efficient BVHs.},

  abstract  = {Hair and fur typically consist of a large number of thin, curved, and densely packed
               strands which are difficult to ray trace efficiently. A tight fitting spatial data
               structure, such as a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH), is needed to quickly determine
               which hair a ray hits. However, the large number of hairs can yield a BVH with a large
               memory footprint (particularly when hairs are pre-tessellated), and curved or diagonal
               hairs cannot be tightly bounded within axis aligned bounding boxes. In this paper,
               we describe an approach to ray tracing hair and fur with improved efficiency, by combining
               parametrically defined hairs with a BVH that uses both axis-aligned and oriented bounding
               boxes. This BVH exploits similarity in the orientation of neighboring hairs to increase
               ray culling efficiency compared to purely axis-aligned BVHs. Our approach achieves
               about 2x the performance of ray tracing pre-tessellated hair models, while requiring
               significantly less memory.},

Our layout computation algorithm utilizes parent-child and spatial localities between the accessed nodes to reduce both the number of cache misses and the size of the working set. Our algorithm also works well for spatial partitioning hierarchies including kd-trees. We use our algorithm to compute layouts of BVHs and spatial partitioning hierarchies of large models composed of millions of triangles. We compare our cache-efficient layouts with other layouts in the context of collision detection and ray tracing. In our benchmarks, our layouts consistently show better performance over other layouts and improve the performance of these applications by 26\%-300\%without any modification of the underlying algorithms or runtime applications.

The first uses a linear ordering derived from spatial Morton codes to build hierarchies extremely quickly and with high parallel scalability. The second is a top-down approach that uses the surface area heuristic (SAH) to build hierarchies optimized for fast ray tracing. Both algorithms are combined into a hybrid algorithm that removes existing bottlenecks in the algorithm for GPU construction performance and scalability leading to significantly decreased build time. The resulting hierarchies are close in to optimized SAH hierarchies, but the construction process is substantially faster, leading to a significant net benefit when both construction and traversal cost are accounted for. Our preliminary results show that current GPU architectures can compete with CPU implementations of hierarchy construction running on multicore systems. In practice, we can construct hierarchies of models with up to several million triangles and use them for fast ray tracing or other applications.},

               In order to speed up the intersection calculation in ray-tracing programs, people have implemented divide-and-conquer strategies such as hierarchical bounding volumes and octrees. Uniform subdivision has also been used to speed up that calculation. Uniform subdivision is undesirable for applications where the objects may be unevenly distributed in space. This is because the amount of memory needed for uniform subdivision is proportional to the highest density of objects, rather than the total number. Hierarchical-bounding volumes can be difficult to implement effectively but can be used to good effect. Hierarchical space subdivision techniques do not suffer the memory problems of uniform subdivision and are also relatively easy to implement. This chapter discusses the best overall hierarchical subdivision technique currently known. There are two basic modules in a BSP tree intersection code. The first module builds the tree by recursively cutting the bounding box of all objects along a median spatial plane. The second module tracks a ray through the leaf nodes of the BSP tree checking for intersections. The BSP tree is built by InitBinTree( ) and Subdivide( ). RayTreeIntersect( ) is the actual tree walking traversal of the BSP tree following a ray.}

  abstract = {Abstract Compared with its competitors such as the bounding volume hierarchy, a drawback of the kd-tree structure is that a large number of triangles are repeatedly duplicated during its construction, which often leads to inefficient, large and tall binary trees with high triangle redundancy. In this paper, we propose a space-efficient kd-tree representation where, unlike commonly used methods, an inner node is allowed to optionally store a reference to a triangle, so highly redundant triangles in a kd-tree can be culled from the leaf nodes and moved to the inner nodes. To avoid the construction of ineffective kd-trees entailing computational inefficiencies due to early, possibly unnecessary, ray-triangle intersection calculations that now have to be performed in the inner nodes during the kd-tree traversal, we present heuristic measures for determining when and how to choose triangles for inner nodes during kd-tree construction. Based on these metrics, we describe how the new form of kd-tree is constructed and stored compactly using a carefully designed data layout. Our experiments with several example scenes showed that our kd-tree representation technique significantly reduced the memory requirements for storing the kd-tree structure, while effectively suppressing the unavoidable frame-rate degradation observed during ray tracing.},

We use conventional kd-tree compatible with the high performing algorithms such as MLRTA or frustum tracing. Proposed technique offers exceptional construction speed maintaining reasonable kd-tree quality for rendering stage. The algorithm builds a kd-tree from scratch each frame, thus prior knowledge of motion /deformation or motion constraints are not required.

  abstract  = {The k-D tree is a well-studied acceleration data structure for ray tracing. It is
               used to organize primitives in a scene to allow efficient execution of intersection
               operations between rays and the primitives. The highest quality k-D tree can be obtained
               using greedy cost optimization based on a surface area heuristc (SAH). While the high
               quality enables very fast ray tracing times, a key drawback is that the k-D tree construction
               time remains prohibitively expensive. This cost is unreasonable for rendering dynamic
               scenes for future visual computing applications on emerging multicore systems. Much
               work has therefore been focused on faster parallel k-D tree construction performance
               at the expense of approximating or ignoring SAH computation, which produces k-D trees
               that degrade rendering time. In this paper, we present two new parallel algorithms
               for building precise SAH-optimized k-D trees, with different tradeoffs between the
               total work done and parallel scalability. The algorithms achieve up to 8x speedup
               on 32 cores, without degrading tree quality and rendering time, yielding the best
               reported speedups so far for precise-SAH k-D tree construction.},

We further extend RTSAH to handle materials that attenuate light instead of fully occluding it, so that we can avoid superfluous intersections with partially transparent objects. For scenes with high occlusion, we substantially lower the number of traversal steps and intersection tests and achieve up to 2 × speedups.},

This algorithm precomputes densely packed clusters of triangles on surfaces. Folowing that, a set of clusters is used to rebuild the BVH in every frame. Our approach utilizes the assumption that groups of connected triangles remain connected throughout the course of the animation. We introduce a novel heuristic to create triangle clusters that are designed for high performance ray tracing. This heuristic combines the density of connectivity, geometric size and the shape of the cluster. Our approach accelerates the BVH builder by an order of magnitude rebuilding only the set of clusters that is much smaller than the original set of triangles. The speed-up is achieved against a ‘brute-force’ BVH builder that repartitions all triangles in every frame of animation without using any pre-clustering. The rendering performance is not affected when a cluster contains a few dozen triangles. We demonstrate the real-time/interactive ray tracing performance for highly-dynamic complex models.},

A constrained tetrahedralization of a scene is a tetrahedralization that respects the faces of the scene geometry. The closest intersection of a ray with a scene is found by traversing this tetrahedralization along the ray, one tetrahedron at a time. We show that constrained tetrahedralizations are a viable alternative to current acceleration structures, and that they have a number of unique properties that set them apart from other acceleration structures: constrained tetrahedralizations are not hierarchical yet adaptive; the complexity of traversing them is a function of local geometric complexity rather than global geometric complexity; constrained tetrahedralizations support deforming geometry without any effort; and they have the potential to unify several data structures currently used in global illumination.},

  abstract  = {This paper introduces a new spatial index structure, called Bounded KD tree (B-KD
               tree), for realtime ray tracing of dynamic scenes. By presenting hardware units of
               all time critical B-KD tree algorithms in the context of a custom realtime ray tracing
               chip we show that this spatial index structure is well suited for hardware implementation.
               B-KD trees are a hybrid spatial index structure that combine the advantages of KD
               trees and Bounding Volume Hierarchies into a single, simple to handle spatial index
               structure. Similar to KD trees, B-KD trees are binary trees where each node considers
               only a single spatial dimension. However, instead of a single splitting plane that
               divides space into two disjoint sub-spaces, each node in B-KD trees contains two pairs
               of axis aligned planes that bound the geometry of its two child nodes. As a bounding
               volume approach B-KD trees allow for simple and efficient updates when changing geometry
               while maintaining the fast traversal operations and simple hardware implementation
               known from KD trees. This enables the support for dynamic scenes with constant mesh

  abstract  = {We introduce a new ray tracing algorithm that exploits the best of previous methods:
               Similar to bounding volume hierarchies the memory of the acceleration data structure
               is linear in the number of objects to be ray traced and can be predicted prior to
               construction, while the traversal of the hierarchy is as efficient as the one of kd-trees.
               The construction algorithm can be considered a variant of quicksort and for the first
               time is based on a global space partitioning heuristic, which is much cheaper to evaluate
               than the classic surface area heuristic. Compared to spatial partitioning schemes
               only a fraction of the memory is used and a higher numerical precision is intrinsic.
               The new method is simple to implement and its high performance is demonstrated by
               extensive measurements including massive as well as dynamic scenes, where we focus
               on the total time to image including the construction cost rather than on only frames
               per second.},

  abstract  = {The complexity of computer graphics illumination models and the associated need to find ways of reducing evaluation time has led to the use of two methods for simplifying the spectral data needed for an exact solution. The first method, where spectral data is sampled at a number of discrete points, has been extensively investigated and bounds for the error are known. Unfortunately, the second method, where spectral data is replaced with tristimulus values (such as RGB values), is very little understood even though it is widely used. In this paper we examine the error incurred by the use of this method by investigating the problem of approximating the tristimulus coordinates of light reflected from a surface from those of the source and the surface. A variation on a well known and widely used approximation is presented. This variation used the XYZ primaries which have unique properties that yield straightforward analytic bounds for the approximation error. This analysis is important because it gives a sound mathematical footing to the widely used method of trichromatic approximation. The error bounds will give some insights into the factors that affect accuracy and will indicate why this method often works quite well in practice.},

  abstract  = {It is often the case that multiplications of whole spectra, component by component, must be carried out, for example when light reflects from or is transmitted through materials. This leads to particularly taxing calculations, especially in spectrally based ray tracing or radiosity in graphics, making a full-spectrum method prohibitively expensive. Nevertheless, using full spectra is attractive because of the many important phenomena that can be modeled only by using all the physics at hand. We apply to the task of spectral multiplication a method previously used in modeling RGB-based light propagation. We show that we can often multiply spectra without carrying out spectral multiplication. In previous work \[J. Opt. Soc. Am. A11, 1553 (1994)\] we developed a method called spectral sharpening, which took camera RGBs to a special sharp basis that was designed to render illuminant change simple to model. Specifically, in the new basis, one can effectively model illuminant change by using a diagonal matrix rather than the 3{\texttimes}3 linear transform that results from a three-component finite-dimensional model \[{\textless}author order$=$"1"{\textgreater}  {\textless}name{\textgreater}    {\textless}first{\textgreater}G.{\textless}/first{\textgreater}    {\textless}last{\textgreater}Healey{\textless}/last{\textgreater}  {\textless}/name{\textgreater}{\textless}/author{\textgreater}{\textless}author order$=$"2"{\textgreater}  {\textless}name{\textgreater}    {\textless}first{\textgreater}D.{\textless}/first{\textgreater}    {\textless}last{\textgreater}Slater{\textless}/last{\textgreater}  {\textless}/name{\textgreater}{\textless}/author{\textgreater}, J. Opt. Soc. Am. A11, 3003 (1994)\]. We apply this idea of sharpening to the set of principal components vectors derived from a representative set of spectra that might reasonably be encountered in a given application. With respect to the sharp spectral basis, we show that spectral multiplications can be modeled as the multiplication of the basis coefficients. These new product coefficients applied to the sharp basis serve to accurately reconstruct the spectral product. Although the method is quite general, we show how to use spectral modeling by taking advantage of metameric surfaces, ones that match under one light but not another, for tasks such as volume rendering. The use of metamers allows a user to pick out or merge different volume structures in real time simply by changing the lighting.}

By splitting the computation into separate transport and reconstruction stages, we gain many advantages including reduced memory usage, the ability to simulate nondiffuse transport, and natural parallelism. Solutions to several theoretical and practical difficulties in implementing this framework are also described. Light sources that vary spectrally and directionally are integrated into a spectral particle tracer using  nonuniform rejection. A new local linear density estimation technique eliminates boundary bias and extends to arbitrary polygons. A mesh decimation algorithm with perceptual calibration is introduced to simplify the Gouraud-shaded representation of the solution for interactive display.},

  abstract = {Abstract We present a spectral rendering technique that offers a compelling set of advantages over existing approaches. The key idea is to propagate energy along paths for a small, constant number of changing wavelengths. The first of these, the hero wavelength, is randomly sampled for each path, and all directional sampling is solely based on it. The additional wavelengths are placed at equal distances from the hero wavelength, so that all path wavelengths together always evenly cover the visible range. A related technique, spectral multiple importance sampling, was already introduced a few years ago. We propose a simplified and optimised version of this approach which is easier to implement, has good performance characteristics, and is actually more powerful than the original method. Our proposed method is also superior to techniques which use a static spectral representation, as it does not suffer from any inherent representation bias. We demonstrate the performance of our method in several application areas that are of critical importance for production work, such as fidelity of colour reproduction, sub-surface scattering, dispersion and volumetric effects. We also discuss how to couple our proposed approach with several technologies that are important in current production systems, such as photon maps, bidirectional path tracing, environment maps, and participating media.},

  abstract = {Abstract In photorealistic image synthesis the radiative transfer equation is often not solved by simulating every wavelength of light, but instead by computing tristimulus transport, for instance using sRGB primaries as a basis. This choice is convenient, because input texture data is usually stored in RGB colour spaces. However, there are problems with this approach which are often overlooked or ignored. By comparing to spectral reference renderings, we show how rendering in tristimulus colour spaces introduces colour shifts in indirect light, violation of energy conservation, and unexpected behaviour in participating media. Furthermore, we introduce a fast method to compute spectra from almost any given XYZ input colour. It creates spectra that match the input colour precisely. Additionally, like in natural reflectance spectra, their energy is smoothly distributed over wide wavelength bands. This method is both useful to upsample RGB input data when spectral transport is used and as an intermediate step for corrected tristimulus-based transport. Finally, we show how energy conservation can be enforced in RGB by mapping colours to valid reflectances.},

In this paper, we propose a method to improve the correctness not of the algorithms themselves, but of their implementation. Specifically, we show that by combining static type checking and generic programming, rendering system and shader development can take advantage of compile-time checking to perform dimensional analysis, i.e. to enforce the correctness of physical dimensions and units in light transport, and geometric space analysis, i.e. to ensure that geometric computations respect the spaces in which points, vectors and normals were defined. We demonstrate our methods by implementing a CPU path tracer and a GPU renderer which previews direct illumination. While we build on prior work to develop our implementations, the main contribution of our work is to show that dimensional analysis and geometric space checking can be successfully integrated into the development of rendering systems and shaders.},

For the general case of natural images in arbitrary viewing conditions, there are many perceptual phenomena that come into play and no comprehensive vision model that is capable of handling them all in an effective way.

               The standard imaging model used in ray tracing is that of a pinhole camera with a flat virtual screen. That model can be supplemented with a cylindrical virtual screen to obtain a 360°, or greater, lateral field of view. By using appropriate angular distribution of samples on the vertical axis, a 180° vertical field of view can be obtained as well. This chapter describes a scheme for sampling a virtual screen in such a way that the entire celestial sphere can be mapped onto a rectilinear image plane, with acceptable distortion. It discusses the construction of a panoramic virtual screen for ray tracing. That projection maps the entire view-dependent celestial sphere to a rectilinear screen. Introduction of distortion is unavoidable in that sphere-to-plane mapping; the distortion in that construction of the viewing projection is of a different character than that of a standard virtual screen, taking the form of horizontal stretching of the image as one approaches the poles of the sphere. The resulting panoramic images may be useful for interactive viewing of static imagery in a virtual reality system.}

Motion blur in photography or cinematography is caused by the motion of objects during the finite exposure time the camera shutter remains open to record the image on film. In computer graphics, the simulation of motion blur is useful both in animated sequences where the blurring tends to remove temporal aliasing effects and in static images where it portrays the illusion of speed or movement among the objects in the scene.The camera model developed for simulating motion blur is described in terms of a generalized image-formation equation. This equation describes the relationship between the object and corresponding image points in terms of the optical system-transfer function. The use of the optical system-transfer function simplifies the description of time-dependent variations of object motion that may occur during the exposure time of a camera. This approach allows us to characterize the motion of objects by a set of system-transfer functions which are derived from the path and velocity of objects in the scene and the exposure time of a camera.},

In this paper it is shown that these artifacts are not an inherent part of point sampling, but a consequence of using regularly spaced samples. If the samples occur at appropriate nonuniformly spaced locations, frequencies above the Nyquist limit do not alias, but instead appear as noise of the correct average intensity. This noise is much less objectionable to our visual system than aliasing. In ray tracing, the rays can be stochastically distributed to perform a Monte Carlo evaluation of integrals in the rendering equation. This is called distributed ray tracing and can be used to simulate motion blur, depth of field, penumbrae, gloss, and translucency.},

While basic imaging properties can be conveniently derived from linear models (like ABCD matrices), these approximations fail to describe nonlinear effects and aberrations that arise in real optics. Such effects can be computed by proper ray tracing, for which, however, finding suitable sampling and filtering strategies is often not a trivial task. Inspired by aberration theory, which describes the deviation from the linear ray transfer in terms of wavefront distortions, we propose a ray-space formulation for nonlinear effects. In particular, we approximate the analytical solution to the ray tracing problem by means of a Taylor expansion in the ray parameters. This representation enables a construction-kit approach to complex optical systems in the spirit of matrix optics. It is also very simple to evaluate, which allows for efficient execution on CPU and GPU alike, including the computation of mixed derivatives of any order. We evaluate fidelity and performance of our polynomial model, and show applications in high-quality offline rendering and at interactive frame rates.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper we present a novel approach to simulate image formation for a wide range of real world lenses in the Monte Carlo ray tracing framework. Our approach sidesteps the overhead of tracing rays through a system of lenses and requires no tabulation. To this end we first improve the precision of polynomial optics to closely match ground-truth ray tracing. Second, we show how the Jacobian of the optical system enables efficient importance sampling, which is crucial for difficult paths such as sampling the aperture which is hidden behind lenses on both sides. Our results show that this yields converged images significantly faster than previous methods and accurately renders complex lens systems with negligible overhead compared to simple models, e.g. the thin lens model. We demonstrate the practicality of our method by incorporating it into a bidirectional path tracing framework and show how it can provide information needed for sophisticated light transport algorithms.},

  abstract  = {"Bokeh" is a Japanese word used to describe the quality of the out-of-focus areas as rendered on film by a physical lens. In areas that are out of focus, the circle of confusion (i.e., the distribution of light absorbed onto film from a single point of light in the scene) is bigger than in areas that are focused. Different lenses distribute light within the circle of confusion differently, depending on a number of factors, like the shape and number of diaphragm blades and the optical design of the lens itself. For example, lenses that are designed to correct for optical aberrations tend to render a circle of confusion that is more intense on the edges and slightly less so in the center. Other lenses, like the so called "mirror" lenses, which include reflective elements besides refractive ones, typically produce donut-shaped circles of confusion since some of the light paths are cut from the center by the reflective element.Moreover, in a real lens the circle of confusion sometimes becomes elliptical on the areas outside of the center of the image, with the shorter axis of the ellipsis oriented radially from it.Standard rendering techniques model depth of field using point sampling techniques which converge towards a bokeh model with uniform density across the circle of confusion. This represents an idealized lens that does not exist in reality. Real lenses have non-uniform bokeh distributions. For example, a smooth, or "creamy" lens will have a Gaussian distribution across the circle of confusion. Real lenses may have different distributions at different points on the film plane.Our technique allows the animator to specify an arbitrary probability density function to represent the distribution of intensity within the circle of confusion. The probability curve is used by the renderer to jitter the location of the sample point on the lens. For example, if the density function is a Gaussian, more samples will be taken towards the center of the lens than at the edges. Conversely, for a density function that simulates a mirror lens, fewer samples are taken near the center of the lens because the mirror blocks light as it moves through the lens. By generating enough sample points, the model converges on the true bokeh density function.We will also show the effect of specifying two shapes for the light distribution, one for close and the other for far focused areas, and the deformation of the circle of confusion so it becomes elliptical on the edges of the image.Future work includes the specification of the diaphragm shape, and the possible implementation of this technique as a particle renderer, which would provide efficient sampling at a much lower cost.Additional work to add support for stratified sampling is also possible.},

The problem of designing a filter for use on images is discussed, and a new family of piecewise cubic filters are investigated as a practical demonstration. Two interesting cubic filters are found, one having good antialiasing properties and the other having good image-quality properties. It is also shown that reconstruction using derivative as well as amplitude values can greatly reduce aliasing.},

Noise reducing filters are used to increase the efficacy of a given sampling rate. The filter width is adaptively controlled to further improve performance.

Constructing an antialiased digital picture from point samples is difficult without resorting to extremely high sampling densities. This paper describes a program that focuses on that problem. While it is impossible to eliminate aliasing totally, it has been shown that nonuniform sampling yields aliasing that is less conspicuous to the observer. An algorithm is presented for fast generation of nonuniform sampling patterns that are optimal in some sense. Some regions of an image may require extra sampling to avoid strong aliasing. Deciding where to do extra sampling can be guided by knowledge of how the eye perceives noise as a function of contrast and color. Finally, to generate the digital picture, the image must be reconstructed from the samples and resampled at the display pixel rate. The nonuniformity of the samples complicates this process, and a new nonuniform reconstruction filter is presented which solves this problem efficiently.},

  abstract = {Abstract Poisson disk distributions have many applications in the field of computer graphics. Besides sampling, Poisson disk distributions are used in object distribution, non-photorealistic rendering and procedural texturing. Over the years, a large number of methods for generating Poisson disk distributions have been proposed, making it difficult to choose the right method for a given application. In this paper, we present a detailed comparison of most techniques for generating Poisson disk distributions. The methods we study include dart throwing, relaxation dart throwing, Lloyd's relaxation, Shade's Poisson disk tiles, tiled blue noise samples, fast hierarchical importance sampling with blue noise properties, edge-based Poisson disk tiles, template Poisson disk tiles, corner-based Poisson disk tiles and recursive Wang tiles for real-time blue noise. Analysing all of these methods within a single framework is one of the major contributions of this work.},

However, producing sample sets with desired efficiency and blue noise statistics has been a major challenge, as existing methods are either sequential with limited speed, or are parallel but only through pre-computed datasets and thus fall short in producing samples with blue noise statistics. We present a Poisson disk sampling algorithm that runs in parallel and produces all samples on the fly with desired blue noise properties. Our main idea is to subdivide the sample domain into grid cells and we draw samples concurrently from multiple cells that are sufficiently far apart so that their samples cannot conflict one another. We present a parallel implementation of our algorithm running on a GPU with constant cost per sample and constant number of computation passes for a target number of samples. Our algorithm also works in arbitrary dimension, and allows adaptive sampling from a user-specified importance field. Furthermore, our algorithm is simple and easy to implement, and runs faster than existing techniques.},

However, existing research so far has focused mainly on isotropic sampling, and challenges remain for the anisotropic scenario both in sample generation and quality verification. We present anisotropic blue noise sampling to address these issues. On the generation side, we extend dart throwing and relaxation, the two classical methods for isotropic blue noise sampling, for the anisotropic setting, while ensuring both high-quality results and efficient computation. On the verification side, although Fourier spectrum analysis has been one of the most powerful and widely adopted tools, so far it has been applied only to uniform isotropic samples. We introduce approaches based on warping and sphere sampling that allow us to extend Fourier spectrum analysis for adaptive and/or anisotropic samples; thus, we can detect problems in alternative anisotropic sampling techniques that were not yet found via prior verification. We present several applications of our technique, including stippling, visualization, surface texturing, and object distribution.},

  abstract  = {We solve the problem of generating a uniform Poisson-disk sampling that is both maximal and unbiased over bounded non-convex domains. To our knowledge this is the first provably correct algorithm with time and space dependent only on the number of points produced. Our method has two phases, both based on classical dart-throwing. The first phase uses a background grid of square cells to rapidly create an unbiased, near-maximal covering of the domain. The second phase completes the maximal covering by calculating the connected components of the remaining uncovered voids, and by using their geometry to efficiently place unbiased samples that cover them. The second phase converges quickly, overcoming a common difficulty in dart-throwing methods. The deterministic memory is O(n) and the expected running time is O(n log n), where n is the output size, the number of points in the final sample. Our serial implementation verifies that the log n dependence is minor, and nearly O(n) performance for both time and memory is achieved in practice. We also present a parallel implementation on GPUs to demonstrate the parallel-friendly nature of our method, which achieves 2.4x the performance of our serial version.},

  abstract = {Abstract We provide a simple algorithm and data structures for d-dimensional unbiased maximal Poisson-disk sampling. We use an order of magnitude less memory and time than the alternatives. Our results become more favorable as the dimension increases. This allows us to produce bigger samplings. Domains may be non-convex with holes. The generated point cloud is maximal up to round-off error. The serial algorithm is provably bias-free. For an output sampling of size n in fixed dimension d, we use a linear memory budget and empirical θ(n) runtime. No known methods scale well with dimension, due to the “curse of dimensionality.” The serial algorithm is practical in dimensions up to 5, and has been demonstrated in 6d. We have efficient GPU implementations in 2d and 3d. The algorithm proceeds through a finite sequence of uniform grids. The grids guide the dart throwing and track the remaining disk-free area. The top-level grid provides an efficient way to test if a candidate dart is disk-free. Our uniform grids are like quadtrees, except we delay splits and refine all leaves at once. Since the quadtree is flat it can be represented using very little memory: we just need the indices of the active leaves and a global level. Also it is very simple to sample from leaves with uniform probability.},

Our technique is specifically designed to handle multidimensional sample domains, and it is well suited for efficiently generating images with effects such as soft shadows, motion blur, and depth of field. These effects are problematic for existing image based adaptive sampling techniques as they operate on pixels, which are possibly noisy results of a Monte Carlo ray tracing process. Our sampling technique operates on samples in the multidimensional space given by the rendering equation and as a consequence the value of each sample is noise-free. Our algorithm consists of two passes. In the first pass we adaptively generate samples in the multidimensional space, focusing on regions where the local contrast between samples is high. In the second pass we reconstruct the image by integrating the multidimensional function along all but the image dimensions. We perform a high quality anisotropic reconstruction by determining the extent of each sample in the multidimensional space using a structure tensor. We demonstrate our method on scenes with a 3 to 5 dimensional space, including soft shadows, motion blur, and depth of field. The results show that our method uses fewer samples than Mittchell's adaptive sampling technique while producing images with less noise.},

We develop a new adaptive rendering algorithm that greatly reduces the number of samples needed for Monte Carlo integration. Our method renders directly into an image-space wavelet basis. First, we adaptively distribute Monte Carlo samples to reduce the variance of the wavelet basis' scale coefficients, while using the wavelet coefficients to find edges. Working in wavelets, rather than pixels, allows us to sample not only image-space edges but also other features that are smooth in the image plane but have high variance in other integral dimensions. In the second stage, we reconstruct the image from these samples by using a suitable wavelet approximation. We achieve this by subtracting an estimate of the error in each wavelet coefficient from its magnitude, effectively producing the smoothest image consistent with the rendering samples. Our algorithm renders scenes with significantly fewer samples than basic Monte Carlo or adaptive techniques. Moreover, the method introduces minimal overhead, and can be efficiently included in an optimized ray-tracing system.},

We develop a novel image-plane adaptive sampling and reconstruction method based on local regression theory. A novel local space estimation process is proposed for employing the local regression, by robustly addressing noisy high-dimensional features. Given the local regression on estimated local space, we provide a novel two-step optimization process for selecting bandwidths of features locally in a data-driven way. Local weighted regression is then applied using the computed bandwidths to produce a smooth image reconstruction with well-preserved details. We derive an error analysis to guide our adaptive sampling process at the local space. We demonstrate that our method produces more accurate and visually pleasing results over the state-of-the-art techniques across a wide range of rendering effects.

Despite arguments suggesting that grey level displays are equivalent to very high resolution bitmaps, the performance of grey level displays has been disappointing.

Instead of the classical (sin x)/x filter, the situation calls for a filter with characteristics matched both to the nature of display on CRTs and to the human visual system. We give examples to illustrate the problems of the existing methods and the advantages of the new methods. Although the techniques are described in terms of text, the results have application to the general antialiasing problem—at least in theory if not in practice.},

ClearType is a software system than enhances the resolution and readability of fonts on displays that contain a repeating pattern of addressable colored sub-pixels. The filtering in ClearType is based on a perceptual model of human vision. The perceptual model leads to an optimization technique for finding the best output values. The results of the optimization can be approximated by pre-filtering each color channel of an input image and then sampling each filtered color image at the spatial locations of the same colored sub-pixels in the display. We refer to this filtering followed by displaced sampling as RGB decimation. RGB decimation eliminates the phase error caused by standard anti-aliasing. A further approximation of the optimal filter yields RGB decimation with displaced box filters. Fourier analysis demonstrates that both the optimization technique and the displaced box filter suppress frequencies that contribute most to color fringing in unfiltered displaced sampling.},

Our approach can be easily incorporated in existing renderers with very little change and with little-to-no computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce the necessary tools needed to analyze the smoothing and post-aliasing properties of the minimum-error approximations.We provide examples of spaces --- generated by the uniform B-splines --- that can be readily used in conjunction with the two-dimensional Cartesian grid. Our experimental results demonstrate that minimum-error approximations significantly enhance image quality by preserving high-frequency details that are usually smoothed out by existing image anti-aliasing approaches.},

From sampling theory, it follows that the ideal interpolation kernel is the sinc function, which is of infinite extent. In the attempt to obtain practical and computationally efficient image processing algorithms, many sinc-approximating interpolation kernels have been devised. In this paper we present the results of a quantitative comparison of 84 different sinc-approximating kernels, with spatial extents ranging from 2 to 10 grid points in each dimension. The evaluation involves the application of geometrical transformations to medical images from different modalities (CT, MR, and PET), using the different kernels. The results show very clearly that, of all kernels with a spatial extent of 2 grid points, the linear interpolation kernel performs best. Of all kernels with an extent of 4 grid points, the cubic convolution kernel is the best (28{\%} -- 75{\%} reduction of the errors as compared to linear interpolation). Even better results (44{\%} -- 95{\%} reduction) are obtained with kernels of larger extent, notably the Welch, Cosine, Lanczos, and Kaiser windowed sinc kernels. In general, the truncated sinc kernel is one of the worst performing kernels.},

  abstract = {Abstract Monte Carlo rendering systems can produce important visual effects such as depth of field, motion blur, and area lighting, but the rendered images suffer from objectionable noise at low sampling rates. Although years of research in image processing has produced powerful denoising algorithms, most of them assume that the noise is spatially-invariant over the entire image and cannot be directly applied to denoise Monte Carlo rendering. In this paper, we propose a new approach that enables the use of any spatially-invariant image denoising technique to remove the noise in Monte Carlo renderings. Our key insight is to use a noise estimation metric to locally identify the amount of noise in different parts of the image, coupled with a multilevel algorithm that denoises the image in a spatially-varying manner using a standard denoising technique. We also propose a new way to perform adaptive sampling that uses the noise estimation metric to identify the noisy regions in which to place more samples. We show that our framework runs in a few seconds with modern denoising algorithms and produces results that outperform state-of-the-art techniques in Monte Carlo rendering.},

First, we adaptively distribute samples in the image plane. Second, we denoise the image using a non-linear filter. Third, we estimate the residual per-pixel error of the filtered rendering, and the error estimate guides the sample distribution in the next iteration. The effectiveness of our approach hinges on the use of a state of the art image denoising technique, which we extend to an adaptive rendering framework. A key idea is to split the Monte Carlo samples into two buffers. This improves denoising performance and facilitates variance and error estimation. Our method relies only on the Monte Carlo samples, allowing us to handle arbitrary light transport and lens effects. In addition, it is robust to high noise levels and complex image content. We compare our approach to a state of the art adaptive rendering technique based on adaptive bandwidth selection and demonstrate substantial improvements in terms of both numerical error and visual quality.

On one hand, feature buffers, such as per pixel normals, textures, or depth, are effective in determining denoising filters because features are highly correlated with rendered images. Filters based solely on features, however, are prone to blurring image details that are not well represented by the features. On the other hand, color buffers represent all details, but they may be less effective to determine filters because they are contaminated by the noise that is supposed to be removed. We propose to obtain filters using a combination of color and feature buffers in an NL-means and cross-bilateral filtering framework. We determine a robust weighting of colors and features using a SURE-based error estimate. We show significant improvements in subjective and quantitative errors compared to the previous state-of-theart. We also demonstrate adaptive sampling and space-time filtering for animations.},

Recent algorithms for defocus blur alone are both fast and accurate. However, motion blur is a considerably more complex type of camera effect, and as a consequence, current algorithms are either slow or too imprecise to use in high quality rendering. We extend previous work on real-time light field reconstruction for defocus blur to handle the case of simultaneous defocus and motion blur. By carefully introducing a few approximations, we derive a very efficient sheared reconstruction filter, which produces high quality images even for a low number of input samples. Our algorithm is temporally robust, and is about two orders of magnitude faster than previous work, making it suitable for both real-time rendering and as a post-processing pass for offline rendering.},

A recent trend is to choose an optimal filter per pixel from a selection of non spatially-varying filters. Nonetheless, the best filter choice is difficult to predict in the absence of a reference rendering. Our approach relies on the observation that the reconstruction error is locally smooth for a given filter. Hence, we propose to construct a dense error prediction from a small set of sparse but robust estimates. The filter selection is then formulated as a non-local optimization problem, which we solve via graph cuts, to avoid visual artifacts due to inconsistent filter choices. Our approach does not impose any restrictions on the used filters, outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques and provides an extensible framework for future reconstruction techniques.},

  abstract   = {The most successful approaches for filtering Monte Carlo noise use feature-based filters (e.g., cross-bilateral and cross non-local means filters) that exploit additional scene features such as world positions and shading normals. However, their main challenge is finding the optimal weights for each feature in the filter to reduce noise but preserve scene detail. In this paper, we observe there is a complex relationship between the noisy scene data and the ideal filter parameters, and propose to learn this relationship using a nonlinear regression model. To do this, we use a multilayer perceptron neural network and combine it with a matching filter during both training and testing. To use our framework, we first train it in an offline process on a set of noisy images of scenes with a variety of distributed effects. Then at run-time, the trained network can be used to drive the filter parameters for new scenes to produce filtered images that approximate the ground truth. We demonstrate that our trained network can generate filtered images in only a few seconds that are superior to previous approaches on a wide range of distributed effects such as depth of field, motion blur, area lighting, glossy reflections, and global illumination.},

  abstract  = {Rasterization hardware provides interactive frame rates for rendering dynamic scenes, but lacks the ability of ray tracing required for efficient global illumination simulation. Existing ray tracing based methods yield high quality renderings but are far too slow for interactive use. We present a new parallel global illumination algorithm that perfectly scales, has minimal preprocessing and communication overhead, applies highly efficient sampling techniques based on randomized quasi-Monte Carlo integration, and benefits from a fast parallel ray tracing implementation by shooting coherent groups of rays. Thus a performance is achieved that allows for applying arbitrary changes to the scene, while simulating global illumination including shadows from area light sources, indirect illumination, specular effects, and caustics at interactive frame rates. Ceasing interaction rapidly provides high quality renderings.}

Our algorithm can be used to accelerate path tracing and final gathering in photon mapping. We compare the method to irradiance caching and the results show that our algorithm renders images of similar or better quality up to five times faster.},

To improve the efficacy of these computations, we propose an alternative theory of sampling. In contrast to traditional formulations for image synthesis, which appeal to nonconstructive Dirac deltas, our theory employs constructive reproducing kernels for the correspondence between continuous functions and pointwise samples. Conceptually, this allows us to obtain a common mathematical formulation of almost all existing numerical techniques for image synthesis. Practically, it enables novel sampling based numerical techniques designed for light transport that provide considerably improved performance per sample. We exemplify the practical benefits of our formulation with three applications: pointwise transport of color spectra, projection of the light energy density into spherical harmonics, and approximation of the shading equation from a photon map. Experimental results verify the utility of our sampling formulation, with lower numerical error rates and enhanced visual quality compared to existing techniques.},

The purpose of the third step, called Color Reproduction Function, is to determine the RGB values displayable on the screen, in such a way that subjective fidelity is reached.

Only a few image appearance models bridge the gap, borrowing ideas from both areas. Our take on scene reproduction reduces computational complexity with respect to the state-of-the-art, and adds a spatially varying model of lightness perception. The predictive capabilities of the model are validated against all psychophysical data known to us, and visual comparisons show accurate and robust reproduction for challenging high dynamic range scenes.},

In particular, we propose a robust technique for estimating the visible and pertinent illumination in a given scene. We do this at very low computational cost by mostly re-using information that is already being computed during the image synthesis process. Conventional illuminant estimations either operate only on 2D image data, or, if they do go beyond pure image analysis, only use information on the luminaires found in the scene. The latter is usually done with little or no regard for how the light sources actually affect the part of the scene that is being viewed. Our technique goes beyond that, and also takes object reflectance into account, as well as the incident light that is actually responsible for the colour of the objects that one sees. It is therefore able to cope with difficult cases, such as scenes with mixed illuminants, complex scenes with many light sources of varying colour, or strongly coloured indirect illumination.},

On the other hand the rendering software mental ray, which is used to generate the majority of visual effects in movies, entirely is based on parametric integration by quasi-Monte Carlo methods and consequently is strictly deterministic. For its superior quality the software even received a Technical Achievement Award (Oscar) by the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 2003. Along the milestones of more than ten years of development of quasi-Monte Carlo methods in computer graphics, we point out that the two previous statements are not contradictory.},

These techniques---light source input, simulation of directional lighting, modeling of scenic projection systems, and full three-dimensional simulation---show the potential for the use of computer graphics in theater design.The light source input component consists of a program for assigning light source attributes with a set of theater lighting icons. This module allows a designer to specify light source characteristics in a way familiar to the discipline and to make preliminary evaluations of the lighting conditions.An extended progressive radiosity method is introduced to simulate the directional lighting characteristics which are specified by the input program.A new projection approach is presented to simulate the optical effects of scenic projectors. In addition, a solution to the distortion problem produced by angular projections is described.The above components are integrated to produce full three-dimensional simulations of the global illumination effects in an opera scene.},

All of them are realized with 2-D image processing operations instead of line tracking processes, so that they can be efficiently combined with conventional surface rendering algorithms.Data about the geometric properties of the surfaces are preserved as Geometric Buffers (G-buffers). Each G-buffer contains one geometric property such as the depth or the normal vector of each pixel. By using G-buffers as intermediate results, artificial enhancement processes are separated from geometric processes (projection and hidden surface removal) and physical processes (shading and texture mapping), and performed as postprocesses. This permits a user to rapidly examine various combinations of enhancement techniques without excessive recomputation, and easily obtain the most comprehensible image.Our method can be widely applied for various purposes. Several of these, edge enhancement, line drawing illustrations, topographical maps, medical imaging, and surface analysis, are presented in this paper.},

Deep-framebuffers are used to store the geometric and optical information of the visible surfaces of an image. The geometric information is represented as collections of oriented points, and the optical information is represented as bi-directional reflection distribution functions, or BRDFs. The BRDFs are generated by procedurally defined surface texturing functions that spatially vary the surfaces' appearances.The deep-framebuffer information is rendered using a multi-pass algorithm built on the OpenGL graphics pipeline. In order to handle both physically-correct as well as non-realistic reflection models used in the film industry, we factor the BRDF into independent components that map onto both the lighting and texturing units of the graphics hardware. A similar factorization is used to control the lighting distribution. Using these techniques, lighting calculations can be evaluated 2500 times faster than previous methods. This allows lighting changes to be rendered at rates of 20Hz in static environments that contain millions of objects of with dozens of unique procedurally defined surface properties and scores of lights.},

Our first contribution is a frequency analysis of motion-blurred scenes, including moving objects, specular reflections, and shadows. We show that motion induces a shear in the frequency domain, and that the spectrum of moving scenes can be approximated by a wedge. This allows us to compute adaptive space-time sampling rates, to accelerate rendering. For uniform velocities and standard axis-aligned reconstruction, we show that the product of spatial and temporal bandlimits or sampling rates is constant, independent of velocity. Our second contribution is a novel sheared reconstruction filter that is aligned to the first-order direction of motion and enables even lower sampling rates. We present a rendering algorithm that computes a sheared reconstruction filter per pixel, without any intermediate Fourier representation. This often permits synthesis of motion-blurred images with far fewer rendering samples than standard techniques require.},

  abstract  = {Lambert's model for body reflection is widely used in computer graphics. It is used extensively by rendering techniques such as radiosity and ray tracing. For several real-world objects, however, Lambert's model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the body reflectance. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent of viewing direction, that of a rough surface increases as the viewing direction approaches the light source direction. In this paper, a comprehensive model is developed that predicts body reflectance from rough surfaces. The surface is modeled as a collection of Lambertian facets. It is shown that such a surface is inherently non-Lambertian due to the foreshortening of the surface facets. Further, the model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between facets. Several experiments have been conducted on samples of rough diffuse surfaces, such as, plaster, sand, clay, and cloth. All these surface demonstrate significant deviation from Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements obtained are in strong agreement with the reflectance predicted by the model.},

Unlike previous derivations that modeled the rough interface as consisting of microareas randomly oriented but flat (facets), this derivation models it as consisting of microareas not only randomly oriented but also randomly curved. Physically, the models are the same, but this new derivation leads to some new results. (1) For any given rough surface, there exists a single, optically smooth, curved surface of revolution of very restricted shape that will reflect radiation in the same distribution as that reflected by the rough interface. (2) Modeling that surface as an ellipsoid of revolution gives a surface-structure function that appears more accurate and useful than existing ones. (3) Unlike the facet derivations, this derivation lends itself to a normalization that gives the absolute, instead of just a comparative, reflectance-distribution function.}

Its ingredients are transport-theoretical models of isotropic or anisotropic scattering layers and smooth or rough boundaries of conductors and dielectrics. Following expansion into a directional basis that supports arbitrary composition, we are able to efficiently and accurately synthesize BSDFs for a great variety of layered structures.Reflectance models created by our system correctly account for multiple scattering within and between layers, and in the context of a rendering system they are efficient to evaluate and support texturing and exact importance sampling. Although our approach essentially involves tabulating reflectance functions in a Fourier basis, the generated models are compact to store due to the inherent sparsity of our representation, and are accurate even for narrowly peaked functions. While methods for rendering general layered surfaces have been investigated in the past, ours is the first system that supports arbitrary layer structures while remaining both efficient and accurate.We validate our model by comparing to measurements of real-world examples of layered materials, and we demonstrate an interactive visual design tool that enables easy exploration of the space of layered materials.

This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.},

  abstract  = {A reflection and refraction model for anisotropic surfaces is introduced. The anisotropy is simulated by small cylinders (added or subtracted) distributed on the anisotropic surface. Different levels of anisotropy are achieved by varying the distance between each cylinder and/or rising the cylinders more or less from the surface. Multidirectional anisotropy is modelled by orienting groups of cylinders in different direction. The intensity of the reflected light is computed by determining the visible and illuminated portion of the cylinders, taking self-blocking into account. We present two techniques to compute this in practice. In one the intensity is computed by sampling the surface of the cylinders. The other is an analytic solution. In the case of the diffuse component, the solution is exact. In the case of the specular component, an approximation is developed using a Chebyshev polynomial approximation of the specular term, and integrating the polynomial.This model can be implemented easily within most rendering system, given a suitable mechanism to define and alter surface tangents. The effectiveness of the model and the visual importance of anisotropy are illustrated with some pictures.},

By fitting low order splines to our results we are able to build analytical shaders. This is highly desirable since animators typically want to texture map the parameters of such a shader for higher realism. We apply our model to the important problem of rendering human skin. Our model does not seem to have appeared before in the optics literature. Most previous models did not handle rough surfaces at the skin's boundary.

Our method considers the true distribution of normals on a surface patch seen through a single pixel, which can be highly complex. We show how to evaluate this distribution efficiently, assuming a Gaussian pixel footprint and Gaussian intrinsic roughness. We also take advantage of hierarchical pruning of position-normal space to rapidly find texels that might contribute to a given normal distribution evaluation.

It applies both to dramatically glittery surfaces that contain mirror-like flakes and also to rough surfaces that exhibit more subtle small scale glitter, without which most glossy surfaces appear too smooth in close-up. These phenomena can in principle be simulated by high-resolution normal maps, but maps with tiny features create severe aliasing problems under narrow-angle illumination. In this paper we present a stochastic model for the effects of random subpixel structures that generates glitter and spatial noise that behave correctly under different illumination conditions and viewing distances, while also being temporally coherent so that they look right in motion. The model is based on microfacet theory, but it replaces the usual continuous microfacet distribution with a discrete distribution of scattering particles on the surface. A novel stochastic hierarchy allows efficient evaluation in the presence of large numbers of random particles, without ever having to consider the particles individually. This leads to a multiscale procedural BRDF that is readily implemented in standard rendering systems, and which converges back to the smooth case in the limit.},

  abstract  = {The reflection of light from most materials consists of two major terms: the specular and the diffuse. Specular reflection may be modeled from first principles by considering a rough surface consisting of perfect reflectors, or micro-facets. Diffuse reflection is generally considered to result from multiple scattering either from a rough surface or from within a layer near the surface. Accounting for diffuse reflection by Lambert?s Cosine Law, as is universally done in computer graphics, is not a physical theory based on first principles.This paper presents a model for subsurface scattering in layered surfaces in terms of one-dimensional linear transport theory. We derive explicit formulas for backscattering and transmission that can be directly incorporated in most rendering systems, and a general Monte Carlo method that is easily added to a ray tracer. This model is particularly appropriate for common layered materials appearing in nature, such as biological tissues (e.g. skin, leaves, etc.) or inorganic materials (e.g. snow, sand, paint, varnished or dusty surfaces). As an application of the model, we simulate the appearance of a face and a cluster of leaves from experimental data describing their layer properties.},

The restriction to micro-facet based layers constitutes no loss of generality, since both perfectly specular and perfectly diffuse surfaces can be seen as limit cases of the micro-facet approach.Such multi-layered surfaces can be used to re-create the appearance of a wide range of different materials, and yield good results without having to perform explicit sub-surface scattering computations.This is achieved through suitable approximations and simplifications of the scattering within the simulated layered surface, while still taking absorption and total internal reflection into account. We also discuss the corresponding probability distribution function that is needed for sampling purposes, and investigate how the flexibility of this new approach is best put to use.},

First, we acquire densely sampled reflectance data for a large collection of different materials. Using these densely sampled measurements we analyze the general surface reflectance function to determine the local signal variation at each point in the function's domain. We then use wavelet analysis to derive a common basis for all of the acquired reflectance functions as well as a corresponding non-uniform sampling pattern that corresponds to all non-zero wavelet coefficients. Second, we show that the reflectance of an arbitrary material can be represented as a linear combination of the surface reflectance functions. Furthermore, our analysis provides a reduced set of sampling points that permits us to robustly estimate the coefficients of this linear combination. These procedures dramatically shorten the acquisition time for isotropic reflectance measurements. We present a detailed description and analysis of our measurement approaches and sampling strategies.},

The difficulty arises from the complex meso structure and reflectance behavior defining the unique look-and-feel of a material. A wide class of such realistic materials can be described as 2D-texture under varying light- and view direction, namely, the Bidirectional Texture Function (BTF). Since an easy and general method for modeling BTFs is not available, current research concentrates on image-based methods, which rely on measured BTFs (acquired real-world data) in combination with appropriate synthesis methods. Recent results have shown that this approach greatly improves the visual quality of rendered surfaces and therefore the quality of applications such as virtual prototyping. This state-of-the-art report (STAR) will present the techniques for the main tasks involved in producing photo-realistic renderings using measured BTFs in details.},

While volume scattering can produce highly realistic images of such materials, creating the required volume density models is difficult. Procedural approaches require significant programmer effort and intuition to design specialpurpose algorithms for each material. Further, the resulting models lack the visual complexity of real materials with their naturally-arising irregularities.This paper proposes a new approach to acquiring volume models, based on density data from X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans and appearance data from photographs under uncontrolled illumination. To model a material, a CT scan is made, resulting in a scalar density volume. This 3D data is processed to extract orientation information and remove noise. The resulting density and orientation fields are used in an appearance matching procedure to define scattering properties in the volume that, when rendered, produce images with texture statistics that match the photographs. As our results show, this approach can easily produce volume appearance models with extreme detail, and at larger scales the distinctive textures and highlights of a range of very different fabrics like satin and velvet emerge automatically---all based simply on having accurate mesoscale geometry.},

Energy-conserving BRDFs can produce plausible rendered images with accurate reflectance behavior, especially near grazing angles. Using our framework, we create an empirical BRDF that allows easy specification of diffuse, specular, and retroreflective materials. We also present a second BRDF model that is useful for data fitting; although it does not preserve energy, it uses the same halfway vector domain as the first model. We show that this data-fitting BRDF can be used to match measured data extremely well using only a small set of parameters.

  abstract  = {When the shape of an object is known, its appearance is determined by the spatially-varying reflectance function defined on its surface. Image-based rendering methods that use geometry seek to estimate this function from image data. Most existing methods recover a unique angular reflectance function (e.g., BRDF) at each surface point and provide reflectance estimates with high spatial resolution. Their angular accuracy is limited by the number of available images, and as a result, most of these methods focus on capturing parametric or low-frequency angular reflectance effects, or allowing only one of lighting or viewpoint variation. We present an alternative approach that enables an increase in the angular accuracy of a spatially-varying reflectance function in exchange for a decrease in spatial resolution. By framing the problem as scattered-data interpolation in a mixed spatial and angular domain, reflectance information is shared across the surface, exploiting the high spatial resolution that images provide to fill the holes between sparsely observed view and lighting directions. Since the BRDF typically varies slowly from point to point over much of an object's surface, this method enables image-based rendering from a sparse set of images without assuming a parametric reflectance model. In fact, the method can even be applied in the limiting case of a single input image.},

  abstract  = {We present a new technique for the visual modeling of spatiallyvarying anisotropic reflectance using data captured from a single view. Reflectance is represented using a microfacet-based BRDF which tabulates the facets' normal distribution (NDF) as a function of surface location. Data from a single view provides a 2D slice of the 4D BRDF at each surface point from which we fit a partial NDF. The fitted NDF is partial because the single view direction coupled with the set of light directions covers only a portion of the "half-angle" hemisphere. We complete the NDF at each point by applying a novel variant of texture synthesis using similar, overlapping partial NDFs from other points. Our similarity measure allows azimuthal rotation of partial NDFs, under the assumption that reflectance is spatially redundant but the local frame may be arbitrarily oriented. Our system includes a simple acquisition device that collects images over a 2D set of light directions by scanning a linear array of LEDs over a flat sample. Results demonstrate that our approach preserves spatial and directional BRDF details and generates a visually compelling match to measured materials.},

  abstract = {Abstract Material models are essential to the production of photo-realistic images. Measured BRDFs provide accurate representation with complex visual appearance, but have larger storage cost. Analytical BRDFs such as Cook-Torrance provide a compact representation but fail to represent the effects we observe with measured appearance. Accurately fitting an analytical BRDF to measured data remains a challenging problem. In this paper we introduce the SGD micro-facet distribution for Cook-Torrance BRDF. This distribution accurately models the behavior of most materials. As a consequence, we accurately represent all measured BRDFs using a single lobe. Our fitting procedure is stable and robust, and does not require manual tweaking of the parameters.},

Our algorithm is based on the property that the distribution of microfacets may be retrieved by solving an eigenvector problem that is built solely from backscattering samples. We show that the eigenvector associated to the largest eigenvalue is always the only solution to this problem, and compute it using the power iteration method. This approach is straightforward to implement, much faster to compute, and considerably more robust than solutions based on nonlinear optimizations. In addition, we provide simple conversion procedures of our fits into both Beckmann and GGX roughness parameters, and discuss the advantages of microfacet slope space to make our fits editable. We apply our method to measured materials from two large databases that include anisotropic materials, and demonstrate the benefits of spatially varying roughness on texture mapped geometric models.},

We have made new measurements of scattering from individual hair fibers that exhibit visually significant effects not predicted by Kajiya and Kay's model. Our measurements go beyond previous hair measurements by examining out-of-plane scattering, and together with this previous work they show a multiple specular highlight and variation in scattering with rotation about the fiber axis. We explain the sources of these effects using a model of a hair fiber as a transparent elliptical cylinder with an absorbing interior and a surface covered with tilted scales. Based on an analytical scattering function for a circular cylinder, we propose a practical shading model for hair that qualitatively matches the scattering behavior shown in the measurements. In a comparison between a photograph and rendered images, we demonstrate the new model's ability to match the appearance of real hair.},

Despite much research on physically based hair rendering, it is currently difficult to benefit from this work because physically based shading models do not offer artist friendly controls. As a consequence much production work so far has used ad hoc shaders that are easier to control, but often lack the richness seen in real hair. We show that physically based shading models fail to provide intuitive artist controls and we introduce a novel approach for creating an art-directable hair shading model from existing physically based models. Through an informal user study we show that this system is easier to use compared to existing systems.

Accounting for roughness in the azimuthal direction leads to an integral across the hair fiber which is efficiently evaluated using a Gaussian quadrature. Solving cubic equations is avoided, caustics are included in the model in a consistent fashion, and more accurate colors are predicted by considering many internal pathways.},

Woods with unusual grain patterns. such as tiger, burl, and birdseye figures, have a strikingly unusual directional reflectance that is prized for decorative applications. With new, high resolution measurements of spatially varying BRDFs. we show that this distinctive appearance is due to light scattering that does not conform to the usual notion of anisotropic surface reflection. The behavior can be explained by scattering from the matrix of wood fibers below the surface, resulting in a subsurface highlight that occurs on a cone with an out-of-plane axis. We propose a new shading model component to handle reflection from subsurface fibers, which is combined with the standard diffuse and specular components to make a complete shading model. Rendered results from fits of our model to the measurement data demonstrate that this new model captures the distinctive appearance of wood.},

Based on our appearance measurements for matte and glossy paper, we find that paper exhibits a combination of subsurface scattering, specular reflection, retroreflection, and surface sheen. Classic microfacet and simple diffuse reflection models cannot simulate the double-sided appearance of a thin layer. Our novel BSDF model matches our measurements for paper and accounts for both reflection and transmission properties. At the core of the BSDF model is a method for converting a multi-layer subsurface scattering model (BSSRDF) into a BSDF, which allows us to retain physically-based absorption and scattering parameters obtained from the measurements. We also introduce a method for computing the amount of light available for subsurface scattering due to transmission through a rough dielectric surface. Our final model accounts for multiple scattering, single scattering, and surface reflection and is capable of rendering paper with varying levels of roughness and glossiness on both sides.},

In this paper, a novel and general approach to physically accurate cloth rendering is presented. By using a statistical volumetric model approximating the distribution of yarn fibers, a prohibitively costly explicit geometrical representation is avoided. As a result, accurate rendering of even large pieces of fabrics containing orders of magnitudes more fibers becomes practical without sacrifying much generality compared to fiber-based techniques. By employing the concept of local visibility and introducing the effective fiber density, limitations of existing volumetric approaches regarding self-shadowing and fiber density estimation are greatly reduced.},

A new scattering model for woven cloth is introduced that describes the reflectance and the texture based on an analysis of specular reflection from the fibers. Unlike data-based models, our procedural model doesn't require image data. It can handle a wide range of fabrics using a small set of physically meaningful parameters that describe the characteristics of the fibers, the geometry of the yarns, and the pattern of the weave. The model is validated against the measurements and evaluated by comparisons to high-resolution video of the real fabrics and to BTF models of two of the fabrics.},

  abstract   = {Woven fabrics have a wide range of appearance determined by their small-scale 3D structure. Accurately modeling this structural detail can produce highly realistic renderings of fabrics and is critical for predictive rendering of fabric appearance. But building these yarn-level volumetric models is challenging. Procedural techniques are manually intensive, and fail to capture the naturally arising irregularities which contribute significantly to the overall appearance of cloth. Techniques that acquire the detailed 3D structure of real fabric samples are constrained only to model the scanned samples and cannot represent different fabric designs.This paper presents a new approach to creating volumetric models of woven cloth, which starts with user-specified fabric designs and produces models that correctly capture the yarn-level structural details of cloth. We create a small database of volumetric exemplars by scanning fabric samples with simple weave structures. To build an output model, our method synthesizes a new volume by copying data from the exemplars at each yarn crossing to match a weave pattern that specifies the desired output structure. Our results demonstrate that our approach generalizes well to complex designs and can produce highly realistic results at both large and small scales.},

Our model is based on extensive Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) measurements of several cloth samples. We have also measured the scattering profile of several different individual cloth threads. Based on these measurements, we derived an empirical shading model capable of predicting the light scattering profile of a variety of threads. From individual threads, we synthesized a woven cloth model, which provides an intuitive description of the layout of the constituent threads as well as their tangent directions. Our model is physically plausible, accounting for shadowing and masking by the threads. We validate our model by comparing predicted and measured light scattering values and show how it can reproduce the appearance of many cloth and thread types, including silk, velvet, linen, and polyester. The model is robust, easy to use, and can simulate the appearance of complex highlights and color shifts that cannot be fully handled by existing models.},

  abstract  = {If you are indoors and reading this document on paper, then the page may be lit by a fluorescent light bulb. The gases inside the bulb absorb high-energy electrons, and then fluoresce, or re-radiate that absorbed energy at a different frequency. The particular gases in common fluorescent bulbs are chosen to be efficient at re-radiating this energy in the visible wavelengths. If you are reading this document on-line, then you're probably reading it on a cathode-ray tube (CRT). The face of the CRT is lined with phosphors, which absorb the high-energy electrons directed at them, and gradually release that energy over time in the visible band. The two phenomena of fluorescence and phosphorescence are not as common as simple reflection and transmission, but do have an important part to play in the complete description of macroscopic physical behavior that should be modeled by image synthesis programs. This paper presents a mathematical model for global energy balancing which includes these phenomena.},

  abstract  = {A continuing trend in computer representation of three dimensional synthetic scenes is the ever more accurate modelling of complex illumination effects. Such effects provide cues necessary for a convincing illusion of reality. The best current methods simulate multiple specular reflections and refractions, but handle at most one scattering bounce per light ray. They cannot accurately simulate diffuse light sources, nor indirect lighting via scattering media, without prohibitive increases in the already very large computing costs.Conventional methods depend implicitly on a particle model; light propagates in straight and conceptually infinitely thin rays. This paper argues that a wave model has important computational advantages for the complex situations. In this approach, light is represented by wave fronts which are stored as two dimensional arrays of complex numbers.The propagation of such a front can be simulated by a linear transformation. Several advantages accrue. Propagations in a direction orthogonal to the plane of a front are convolutions which can be done by FFT in O(n log n) time rather than the n 2 time for a similar operation using rays. A typical speedup is about 10,000. The wavelength of the illumination sets a resolution limit which prevents unnecessary computation of elements smaller than will be visible. The generated wavefronts contain multiplicities of views of the scene, which can be individually extracted by passing them through different simulated lenses. Lastly the wavefront calculations are ideally suited for implementation on available array processors, which provide more cost effective calculation for this task than general purpose computers.The wave method eliminates the aliasing problem; the wavefronts are inherently spatially filtered, but substitutes diffraction effects and depth of focus limitations in its stead.},

  abstract   = {We present a novel method of simulating wave effects in graphics using ray-based renderers with a new function: the Wave BSDF (Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function). Reflections from neighboring surface patches represented by local BSDFs are mutually independent. However, in many surfaces with wavelength-scale microstructures, interference and diffraction requires a joint analysis of reflected wavefronts from neighboring patches. We demonstrate a simple method to compute the BSDF for the entire microstructure, which can be used independently for each patch. This allows us to use traditional ray-based rendering pipelines to synthesize wave effects. We exploit the Wigner Distribution Function (WDF) to create transmissive, reflective, and emissive BSDFs for various diffraction phenomena in a physically accurate way. In contrast to previous methods for computing interference, we circumvent the need to explicitly keep track of the phase of the wave by using BSDFs that include positive as well as negative coefficients. We describe and compare the theory in relation to well-understood concepts in rendering and demonstrate a straightforward implementation. In conjunction with standard raytracers, such as PBRT, we demonstrate wave effects for a range of scenarios such as multibounce diffraction materials, holograms, and reflection of high-frequency surfaces.},

A finite difference time domain method is employed to advance the electric and magnetic fields in a scene. Surfaces containing wavelength scaled structures are created, the interaction of the electromagnetic waves with these nano-structured materials is calculated, and the sub-surface interference and diffraction effects are modelled. The result is a reflectance function with wavelength composition and spatial distribution properties that could not have been predicted using classic computer graphic ray tracing approaches.

The model has been especially intended for computer graphics applications and therefore includes two main features: simplicity (a small number of intuitively understandable parameters controls the model) and efficiency (the formulation provides adequation to Monte-Carlo rendering techniques and/or hardware implementations).},

The analytical model assumes that the surface consists of small, randomly disposed, mirror-like facets. Specular reflection from these facets plus a diffuse component due to multiple reflections and/or internal scattering are postulated as the basic mechanisms of the reflection process. The effects of shadowing and masking of facets by adjacent facets are included in the analysis. The angular distributions of reflected flux predicted by the analysis are in very good agreement with experiment for both metallic and nonmetallic surfaces. Moreover, the analysis successfully predicts the off-specular maxima in the reflection distribution which are observed experimentally and which emerge as the incidence angle increases. The model thus affords a rational explanation for the off-specular peak phenomenon in terms of mutual masking and shadowing of mirror-like, specularly reflecting surface facets.}

The new form of the BRDF thus allows one to compute sea reflected radiance more than 100 times faster than the traditional numerical solutions. The repercussions of the approximations used in the model are discussed. Using the analytical form of the BRDF, an analytical approximation is also obtained for the reflected sun radiance that is always good to within 1\% of the numerical solution for sun elevations of more than 10{\textdegree} above the horizon. The model is validated against measured sea radiances found in the literature and is shown to be in very good agreement.}

In current models, the shadowing effects occurring for both the transmitter and the receiver are assumed to be independent of their azimuthal directions. This assumption makes it possible to compute separately the shadowing probabilities in each direction. However, if the transmitter and receiver azimuthal directions are close, these probabilities become strongly correlated. In such a configuration, the uncorrelation approximation induces an overestimation of the average illumination function up to as well as a discontinuity. In this paper, assuming surfaces of isotropic Gaussian statistics with independent heights and slopes, this correlation is taken into account. Comparisons of our model with Monte Carlo simulations are made and show a very good agreement, which validates our approach. }
